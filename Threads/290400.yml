  pPost: 'I''m surprised this isn''t a thread in Politics yet, unless I missed it
    at some point? If so, I apologize. Yesterday, at least 3 POTUS hopefuls weighed
    in on the debate. Christie and Rand Paul are both saying vaccines should not be
    mandatory (although Christie may have backtracked) while Hillary throws her hat
    firmly in the ''vaccines work, be responsible'' camp. Meanwhile - Shep Smith has
    a bit of a freakout on Fox News claiming the vaccine opponents are ''science-deniers''
    (though I''m not sure if that''s a good argument to use against Fox News viewers,
    some of them seem to take a lot of pride in being anti-science) AO - what say
    you? Has the science been settled? Should the government mandate vaccines for
    the greater social benefit? I''m guessing some libertarian-minded posters will
    say no to that. I''m on the fence (not about the science, but the politics behind
    mandating them) and I''m curious to hear what you all think. '

    I don''t think we would get anywhere discussing vaccines, as I think a healthy

    look at the Amish). I hope to agree to disagree to focus on things that can better
    be discussed. Quote: Originally Posted by Stan I don''t care what the efficacy

    to some things that we have introduced in this world over the past 100 years.
    I am trying to minimize my exposure to such things as much as possible to avoid
    as many illnesses in mine and my childrens lifetime as possible. Nothing is shown
    to absolutely cause an increase in autism, but it has to come from somewhere.
    As a parent with a special needs child, I don''t need to complicate things more
    by giving him three diseases at once for his body to try and manage. In fact,
    I wouldn''t be surprised if vaccines have caused his allergies when he was an
    infant. No proof, but he shouldn''t have been vaccinated as he was already at
    risk. Glad to know that doctors don''t follow the correct protocol to begin with

    ever, or a million people. What I do know is that autism is a mental disorder,
    and many vaccines contain heavy metals known to cause brain malfunctions. I don''t

    in much higher rates than these vaccinatable diseases ever have. I will continue
    to raise my special needs children the way I choose to, and there is nothing you
    can do to stop me. I will fight to the death over the principle of the parental
    freedoms, regardless of vaccines. Good luck to you. '

    Stuff like kids dying from eczema because their parents refused real medicine

    I am not going to convince you of something, and nor am I trying to. The fact
    of the matter is that vaccines, and most medical care for chronic issues (not
    talking about things including surgery for example) are not well tested. I do
    not accept the metrics that are used to determine the overall efficacy of medical
    advancements. The human body is far more complex than you, I, or even the medical
    community really can understnd. There is a lot more to life than simply how many
    years a brain or heart can function. You cannot convince me otherwise, so drop
    it. I accept that you have your own opinions, and do nothing to try to prevent
    others from using it. I am only here to share my beliefs. But if you would rather
    not have an open mind to hear what others have to say, then I will go away, because
    this argument is pointless. Again, my decisions regarding healthcare are no different
    than a parent''s choice in providing food for their children. Kids get all sorts

    vaccinatable diseases ever have. I will continue to raise my special needs children

    Good luck to you. You mean like the 1918 flu outbreak that infected over 500 million

    I try to be, when possible. Thank you for the compliment. I''ll admit, my response
    was a little snarky. Maybe I''m not seeing the whole picture, but it seems like
    the vast majority of cancer that affects kids is not due to lifestyle/nutrition,
    as those types generally take decades to manifest. I''m not a doctor, though,
    so I don''t know how prevalent preventable cancers are in children. Obesity, on
    the other hand, is very preventable. '

    We were just talking about the flu of 1912 and how deadly it was. Don''t you think
    more people were drinking raw milk back then? Why didn''t 1912 raw milk magically
    protect people like you think it does today? (I found this to backup the idea
    that pasteurization of milk was less common in 1912) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization
    Quote: Originally Posted by the wiki ...Before the widespread urban growth caused
    by industrialization, people kept dairy cows even in urban areas and the short
    time period between production and consumption minimised the disease risk of drinking
    raw milk.[18] However, as urban densities increased and supply chains lengthened
    to the distance from country to city, raw milk (often days old) began to be recognised
    as a source of disease. For example, between 1912 and 1937 some 65,000 people
    died of tuberculosis contracted from consuming milk in England and Wales alone.[19] '

    But seriously, drunk driving and not vaccinating are almost identical: -You take
    a risk by choosing what to put into your body -Sometimes, that risk directly causes
    someone else to die -For drunk driving, you go to prison for many many years.
    Should be the same for vaccinating, shouldn''t it? '

    measles from some anti-vaxxer nutjob''s kid just by being in the same room with
    them. '

    had the Red Measles, thankfully none died. So I agree with you that people who
    have never seen kids with these diseases, or die from these diseases are much
    less likely to be persuaded by arguments once they have decided that they will
    not vaccinate their kids. I really feel bad because I bet 99% or more of them
    were themselves vaccinated with no ill effects, yet for some reason believe that
    there is a significant risk to ALL children from vaccines. Quote: Originally Posted

    But I am glad you are OK with it. I am a little confused on your stance on vaccines.
    It seems that you have real (possibly proven?) medical fears for not vaccinating
    your children. Yet it often seems you are arguing that no one needs to be vaccinated.
    I believe that vaccines are safe for the vast, vast majority (maybe 99.9+%) of
    children and that most side effects are very minor. The real problem is trying
    to figure out which children they aren''t safe for and a way to identify them
    and exempt them from the requirement. Quote: Originally Posted by pete5383 Yes,

    no children ever got childhood cancers before the introduction of pasteurization,
    GMO foods or pesticides and such that make things not organic. BTW, ''organic''
    is such a misnomer. '

    weather and would consider a 50 degree day in the middle of July to be quite cold.
    Likewise, the average low temperature where I was is more like -20, but the locals
    are used to -40 which happens frequently, and +10 was considered quite warm. I
    apologize if I incorrectly used the word "average" in my post when I should have

    by that time for benefits to continue. I mean, always if there''s a valid medical
    reason not to vaccinate... fine. (Pregnancy isn''t the only example.) I''m certainly
    not advocating that we force vaccinations on people when doctors feel it''s unsafe. '

    This is an obvious exception. A not from a doctor saying you''re allergic to eggs/latex

    evidence concerning the therapeutic value of vitamin C for the prophylaxis and
    treatment of the common cold. Data sources: Cochrane, PubMed, Natural Standard,
    and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine databases were
    searched to identify and acquire primary research reports, literature reviews,
    and secondary analyses related to the clinical objective. Published clinical trials,
    literature reviews, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were evaluated for evidence-based
    practice implications. Conclusions: Vitamin C is frequently used for the treatment
    and prophylaxis of the common cold; however, no published recommendations were
    found in a review of the nurse practitioner literature that specifically address
    the efficacy of vitamin C for the common cold. Our literature review revealed
    that vitamin C is not effective at preventing the common cold in the general adult
    population; however, it is effective at preventing colds when consumed regularly
    by athletes training in subarctic conditions. We also found that regular vitamin
    C consumption may reduce the duration of cold symptoms in both adults and children,
    but it does not decrease the severity of cold symptoms. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/1...0B7344C.f03t03 '

    seen MMR vaccination recommendations for infants that varied based on the vaccination
    status of the mother. A friend of a friend''s 8-month old (actually the mom is
    a HS classmate of mine, but not someone I kept in touch with after graduation)
    recently contracted whooping cough (aka pertussis) and the friend was explaining
    to me that pregnant women are supposed to get the TDaP vaccine in weeks 35-37
    of pregnancy as it will pass on some immunity to the infant. But in this particular
    case mom went into labor around 33 or 34 weeks and hadn''t gotten the vaccine
    yet. TDaP (aka "tetanus shot", but it really protects against tetanus, diptheria,
    and pertussis these days) is one you''re supposed to have every 10 years. But
    a lot of adults don''t keep theirs current, and more and more kids are never getting
    the shot in the first place. (Regardless of when they were last immunized, apparently
    pregnant women are supposed to get it late in their pregnancy to pass some of
    it to their baby in utero.) Anyway, the stories of this friend-of-a-friend sound
    pretty dang horrible. The baby just can''t get enough air and frequently turns
    blue. Awful. '

    This is what I came here to read. I get emails from nutters in my extended family
    and my wife herself has succumbed to some of the pseudoscience. Reading the articles
    sent to me and some of the comments on them [shudder] was making me despair for
    humanity. I should have come to the AO sooner, so I could read some complete sentences
    on the matter. I read recently that part of the problem here is the split-screen
    24 hour news cycle where journalists have it in their heads that they need to
    have both "sides" represented, while in the case of vaccinations there isn''t
    that second side, scientifically speaking. Nevertheless we end up enduring people
    like Jack Wolfson getting his say on CNN. Once we stop suffering fools over vaccines
    we can move onto tackling the flat-earthers'' concerns about the whereabouts of
    Malaysian Airlines flight 370. '

    Not necessarily. We didn''t have a mandatory vaccine requirement before - and
    the vast majority of people got them. The problem is not that we''re not forcing
    people to take them; the problem is that people have lost confidence in them.
    Trying to use force in this case is probably going to aggravate the problem. '

    Free riding on other people''s vaccinations is attractive, as long as almost everyone
    is included in the "other people". If I''m sure that my child will never encounter
    someone with a contagious measles infection, then vaccination has no benefits.
    Even if the risk is tiny, it''s still true that tiny > zero. Of course, as more
    people choose to not vaccinate, the cost of that option goes up. '

    Nope. Stan knows what you can never know: if you eat a proper diet you become
    invincible. Not even bullets can harm you. I think some people have experiences
    eternal mortal life from proper diets. Those big healthy guys weren''t eating
    exactly the right combinations of food so they died. Tough luck idiots. Eat better

  pPost: 'By the way, I have a personal bias. When I was a child there was a call
    to re-immunize all the kids who had measles vaccine in some time range, because
    it turned out the batches of vaccine were not uniform, and some didn''t work well.
    I was re-vaccinated, and shortly after that had a lot of vague illnesses that
    my mother thought might have been triggered by the vaccine. As a result, (and
    also because my brother had a mild case of measles after his first vaccine, which
    perhaps had not been properly killed) she got the family doctor to write up a
    medical exemption for the rest of her children. In retrospect, I don''t think
    it was the vaccine, I think it was because I was suffering from depression. And
    I have immunized my kids with whatever was recommended, including some "opitional"
    vaccines. I went out of my way to get my son vaccinated for HPV shortly after
    the vaccine was approved for boys. But.... I''m glad my mother was able to opt
    out. It was important to her at the time. And a few semi-medical exemptions here
    and there do not seriously compromise herd immunity. I think the government should
    have the power to force people to be vaccinated in cases where there is an urgent
    public health need. But I don''t think that applies to all, or even most, of the
    vaccines currently recommended. In times of non-crisis, I think there should be
    not-too-difficult ways to avoid getting your child vaccinated. Or to avoid some
    of the recommended vaccines, if you care strongly about it. I don''t think the
    current complete list of recommended vaccines ought to be mandated. Strongly encouraged,
    sure. But not mandated. I''m not sure what I think the best rule would be. '

    You could also only cover for folks who are either 1) vaccinated and the vaccine

    reasons to not be vaccinated. I''m guessing that would be allowed. Slightly related
    example (but admittedly only slightly): a lot of church''s have candlelight services
    on Christmas Eve where at the end of the service they sing Silent Night and every
    member of the congregation is holding a candle. Doing so violates a lot of fire
    codes, but the churches can do it anyway because freedom of religion. But I''ve
    seen churches roll this back in recent years because even though they are legally
    allowed to do it and no one can be jailed over it, sometimes the property insurer
    specifies that they won''t cover the damage if the church burns down as a result.
    If that doesn''t violate the first amendment, I don''t see why refusing to cover
    vaccine-preventable diseases for folks who could get vaccines but choose not to
    for religious reasons would violate the first amendment either. I am not an expert

    *special cases like kids with compromised immune systems aside I absolutely agree
    that it''s a blurry line between what should be illegal and what is fine. I think
    that immunization is nowhere near the line. The line is somewhere around here,
    in my opinion: If your 6 month old comes down with a cold, you give her some baby
    aspirin or whatever and make an appointment for the doctor on Monday, and all
    of a sudden it turns for the worst and the kid dies overnight, that is a sad tragedy
    and the parents deserve our sympathy. This is the other side of the line Quote:
    A couple whose baby daughter died after they treated her with homeopathic remedies
    instead of conventional medicine have been found guilty of manslaughter. Gloria
    Thomas died aged nine months after spending more than half her life with eczema.
    The skin condition wore down her natural defences and left her completely vulnerable
    when she developed an eye infection that killed her within days of developing.
    Thomas Sam, 42, a homeopath, and Manju Sam, 37, of Earlwood, Sydney, were charged
    with manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. Thomas Sam remained passive as
    the jury delivered its verdict but Manju Sam''s face crumpled and she buried it
    in her husband''s shoulder. After the jury was discharged, the enormity of what
    had occurred came over her in waves , crying intermittently and then recovering.
    Justice Peter Johnson granted them bail on strict reporting conditions, but Thomas
    Sam was led into the cells to wait for $30,000 to be posted as surety. The couple,
    who had held hands through much of the case, hugged one another for a long time
    before he left with security. The court heard the couple took Gloria to various
    health professionals, but while they abandoned each conventional medication she
    was prescribed within a short time of starting it, they solidly pursued homeopathic
    remedies. The Crown said these did not work, and all the while Gloria''s tiny
    body required more nutrition than her mother''s milk could provide, and her immune
    system became ever more depleted. By the time she died, she was the weight of
    an average three-month-old, her body was covered with angry blotches and her once
    black hair had turned completely white. Gloria had developed eczema when she was
    four months old, a condition she probably inherited from her mother, which flared
    and subsided throughout the rest of her short life. But the couple, who were raised
    and educated in India where homeopathy is accepted as equivalent to conventional
    medicine, were steadfast to their homeopathic remedies and ignored completely
    or quickly discarded other treatment. A general practitioner booked them an appointment
    with a dermatologist they did not attend because they took the child to India
    instead, a course of action the doctor told them was "cruel". They also visited
    two doctors in India, but discarded the advice of one to return to him every second
    day, instead consulting a succession of homeopaths including Thomas Sam''s brother,
    who had recently completed his dissertation on eczema. Thomas and Manju Sam''s
    lawyers said they had been devoted but misguided parents, and their conduct fell
    far short of gross criminal negligence. They had treated Gloria''s eczema with
    the best intentions, and none of the health professionals they consulted - homeopathic
    and conventional - had warned them that the condition could imperil her life.
    But they did not deny that Gloria was uncomfortable for much of her life. Any
    improvements in her condition after homeopathic treatment were short-lived, and
    the rest of the time she was irritable and in pain, crying whenever she was moved
    and taking refuge only on her mother''s breast. Gloria''s miserable life proved
    all the more poignant by the evidence given at the trial by Dr Orli Wargon, the
    dermatologist with whom Gloria missed her appointment when the family went to
    India instead. Dr Wargon said she would have applied an aggressive treatment program
    that should have seen the child recover within 24 hours: "Not completely cured,
    but her skin would look better very, very quickly." Nine days after they returned
    from India, Thomas and Manju Sam finally took Gloria to hospital for an eye infection
    they thought was conjunctivitis, and she was immediately rushed into emergency
    to be treated by a team of medical experts. It turned out her cornea was melting.
    Doctor after doctor told the jury that by the time they saw Gloria in those last
    few days her skin condition was unlike any they had seen before. Dr Susannah Cunningham,
    who was then a pediatric emergency registrar, said Gloria was among only a handful
    of children whose cases she had been unable to forget. "I think it''s the pain
    that has made this case stand out for me in my memory," Dr Cunningham said. "I
    can vividly recall where she was in the emergency department. I remember the 6?
    hours I was involved very clearly. She was in a lot of pain and had been suffering
    and that''s something that doesn''t sit well with any pediatrician." Another doctor,
    dermatologist Penelope Lee, said she had asked Manju Sam why she had not taken
    the child to hospital earlier: "And I don''t think she gave me an answer for that.
    She just cried." Gloria died on May 8, 2002, in her mother''s arms, unable in
    her weakened condition to combat the septicemia that had developed in her left
    eye. The pathologist who did the autopsy, Ella Sugo, said she had sought advice
    from experts outside Australia because she had never seen a child so malnourished
    and her condition was at a level more commonly observed in third world countries.

    I don''t know if there are any serious / sound objections to the vaccine though.
    I''ve heard a lot of ridiculous ones (like that it will encourage promiscuity).
    HPV is ridiculously contagious. My ob-gyn said that the following scenario is
    possible: -Person 1 with HPV uses the toilet or urinal, handling their privates
    in the process. -Person 1 doesn''t wash hands.* -Person 1 shakes hands with Person
    2, who now has HPV on their hands. -Person 2 uses the toilet, handling their privates
    in the process. -Person 2 now has HPV. In this case there is zero sexual contact
    whatsoever and person 2 (who may be a virgin) now has HPV. *I hear that if they
    only use the urinal, a lot of men don''t bother washing their hands if there was
    no splashing. So this seems pretty realistic. So I''d have to hear the reasons
    why the anti-HPV-vaxxers don''t want the vaccine, and if they can''t come up with
    anything better than autism or promoting sexual promiscuity, well then I think
    a mandate is a fine idea. It should be for boys *and* girls though... is it? '

    to be exposed to measles by your kid regardless of whether your insurance covers
    treatment for it or not, because by the time you know your kid has measles they
    are most likely already through their contagious period and have already infected

    that period from Monday to Saturday while your parents thought you just had a
    cold you are spreading the disease every time you cough, sneeze, or touch someone

    parent that didn''t immunize his/her child just because (as in: not because of

    Paying more for insurance seems reasonable. I think it would be awfully hard to
    prove that Kid 1 was the one who infected Kid 2. Furthermore, there would be no
    proof that Kid 1 would have developed immunity if he''d been vaccinated. That
    can easily be taken into account for health insurance. If 99% of the immunized
    population is immune, then increase the amount of insurance by the probability
    of an unimmunized person getting the disease x cost of treating the disease x
    .99. Do this for each vaccine-preventable disease and tack the total on to the
    premium. But in terms of determining liability, it''s not so clear cut IMO, with
    the bigger issue being that there''s really no way to prove which person infected
    which other person. '

    who have immune deficiencies don''t have another kid lying around just in case
    you decide not to vaccinate. Those parents are counting on the parents with healthier
    kids to make the right decision and keep the herd immunity up so that their kid
    might have a chance of avoiding dying from the nasty preventable diseases before
    they are old & strong enough to survive them (if they ever are). Quote: (and I

    measles roughly 10 years ago was just over $300 in the US. Allowing for inflation
    and greedy doctors, let''s be uber conservative and say $500. Which means that
    increasing monthly insurance premiums will probably cost the parents a penny or
    two per month. Wow, you really taught them a lesson there. I bet they show up
    in droves to get their kids vaccinated after seeing their new bill. ... which
    brings me back my suggestion that paying for the whole treatment out of pocket
    would be a more effective penalty. '

    If 99% of the immunized population is immune, then increase the amount of insurance
    by the probability of an unimmunized person getting the disease x cost of treating
    the disease x .99. Do this for each vaccine-preventable disease and tack the total
    on to the premium. But in terms of determining liability, it''s not so clear cut
    IMO, with the bigger issue being that there''s really no way to prove which person
    infected which other person. Then require them to pay "insurance" that goes into
    a fund to compensate people who suffer from their negligence. "Premiums" paid
    until your kid is old enough to decide for themselves - if they don''t get vaccinated
    they get to start paying in. If the fund starts running short, premiums go up.
    Call it insurance, call it a tax, call it a fine - I don''t care. They are, as

    if you have a good immune system. However, not always. Various strains of HPV
    cause all sorts of maladies ranging from cervical and penile cancers (which can
    be deadly) to genital warts (which are not deadly but pretty dang annoying from
    what I understand) to lesions on one''s uterus (also not deadly but can possibly
    lead to infertility if left untreated). Some forms of HPV strains don''t appear
    to cause anything at all (although perhaps they cause something that we just haven''t
    linked to HPV... yet). The HPV vaccine is FDA approved to protect you from 4 strains
    of HPV. Two of those strains cause most cases of cervical cancer, and the other
    two strains cause most cases of genital warts. There is significant evidence that
    the vaccine provides some protection from other strains of HPV as well, but the
    FDA has not given the green light to market it as doing so. The vaccine does not
    guarantee that you won''t get one of those strains however... I believe that it''s
    less effective in preventing transmission of those 4 strains of HPV than the MMR
    or polio vaccine is in preventing measles, mumps, rubella, or polio, for example.
    But it definitely reduces your chances by a lot. '

    get the vaccine after youre like 26 or something Last time I checked it was FDA
    approved for females ages 9 - 26 and males ages 9 - 15. The current thinking is
    to vaccinate kids before they become sexually active because, despite my bathroom
    example, sexual contact is by far the most common means of HPV transmission. However,
    I got the vaccine in my 30''s (it didn''t exist when I was 9-26). FDA approval
    simply means that they go through the rigorous trials that the FDA requires for
    those folks. At first it was not approved for boys, but boys were later added.
    In the UK they routinely use the exact same vaccine (Gardasil is the brand-name)
    in women older than 26 and in men (and they used it in boys before there was FDA
    approval for boys). If your doctor feels that you will benefit from a vaccine,
    they can give it to you even if you''re not in the "FDA approved" category. Even
    if you''ve had one (or two or three) of the common strains of HPV, the vaccine
    can protect you from the other three (or two or one). And even if you know you''ve
    had HPV, you probably don''t know which strains you''ve had. '

    in the US. Prior to vaccination, hundreds of thousands of people got measles every
    year, a few hundred died of measles, and about twice that many suffered permanent
    brain damage from measles. (I think that''s what happened to Helen Keller.) http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/20...d-vaccination/
    While HPV can''t be cured, cervical cancer generally can be. Pap smears are one
    of the most effective screening tests in medicine (after colonoscopies) and it''s
    extremely rare for a women who gets regular pap tests to die of cervical cancer,
    because they usually develop slowly enough that there''s plenty of time between
    detection of abnormal cells and development of invasive cancer to take care of
    it. Not that it''s awesome to have your cervix removed, but an adult CAN protect
    themselves from deaths caused by HPV whether or not their parents had them vaccinated.
    (HPV-induced throat cancers also tend to grow slowly, and by symptomatic in time
    to treat. The mortality rate for non-HPV throat cancer is much higher than for
    HPV throat cancer because of this.) As I said, I went to some trouble to get my
    kids vaccinated, and got my son vaccinated pretty much as soon as the vaccine
    was approved for boys. But I have mixed feelings as to whether there should be
    a government mandate for HPV vaccination. And if it weren''t for the cancer link,
    I would oppose that mandate. '

    is just under 0.03%. So it''s low, but not as low as the rate of death from cancer
    caused by HPV. Another big difference is that nearly everyone who contracts measles
    will experience the symptoms, while a large percentage of people with HPV won''t
    ever even know they have it unless they get tested, and according to the numbers,
    virtually none of the people that do have it will die of cancer due to having
    it. Now, for what it''s worth, I agree with you that the HPV vaccination should
    be pushed more, but I also believe that ALL vaccinations that have been proven
    both effective and safe should be pushed more. Lastly, HPV vaccination is something
    that you can choose to get on your own when you are an adult (since you become
    an adult in the middle of the recommended age range). I agree with you that it
    should be pushed more so that more people are protected, but for the most part
    the people who are being exposed are old enough to decide for themselves which
    course of action to take. For measles, on the other hand, the hardest hit are
    kids that are too young to decide for themselves and people who cannot be immunized,
    and they are being punished for the bad decisions that their parents are making. '

  pPost: 'So, I agree with erose, there is a much stronger case for the government
    to require measles vaccine than for the government to require HPV vaccine. 1)
    If you can''t get the vaccine, or if you get it and it doesn''t work (say, you
    are immune compromised) there is nothing you can do to reduce your risk other
    than lock yourself up away from people. 2) If you get measles, there''s not much
    you can do to reduce the risk of death or brain damage. In contrast, if you get
    HPV, regular exams can pretty much prevent the worst outcomes. So the damage that
    someone who refuses to get vaccinated does to innocent bystanders is much greater.
    Perhaps less important, people who get HPV rarely get critically ill from it.
    They can still work and generally be productive. People who get measles are almost
    always seriously ill for a while, and need to stay home and can''t work or go
    to school. Not as big a deal, but a greater public health cost. '

  pPost: 'In the not-too-distant future of year 2075, vaccines have eliminated all
    communicable diseases. There is no flu, nor measles, malaria, common cold, HPV,
    HIV, herpes, chicken pox, strep throat, or sinus infections. Yet, people are sicker
    than ever. Fully 10% of humans develop malignant cancers each year and it''s unclear
    why. Improved treatments have drastically improved cancer mortality rates, but
    significant morbidity still exists. With other diseases under control, almost
    all health funding has been diverted to cancer research, mostly toward treatment
    research. Then, one June day in 2075, a shocking announcement is made. A small
    team of virologists at Harvard announce they have discovered a previously unknown
    family of polyomaviruses which induce malignant tumor formation through a novel
    mechanism. Worse, it appears there is a highly controversial source of these viruses
    - as their research indicates, up to 80% of all vaccines are contaminated with
    these viruses. Contaminated mammalian kidney cells used to develop the vaccines
    are implicated as the likely source. Backlash to the research is swift and fierce.
    Vaccines, after all, have ushered in a new nearly disease-free world. They can''t
    be the cause! They just can''t be! Major pharmaceutical companies rush to organize
    their own research teams to find out where the Harvard research went wrong. The
    media attacks the Harvard team as crackpots using highly flawed statistical methodologies.
    Even though this exact thing has happened in the past (1), people are reluctant
    to believe it, fearing it''s a form of "anti-vax hysteria" returning. Finally,
    after 8 arduous months, several new industry-funded studies confirm what everyone
    knew: vaccines can''t be the cause. Even though the mechanism of action is sound
    in animal studies - various vaccines contain polyomaviruses which, usually latent,
    can be "activated" by the immune response and begin causing malignant tumors -
    the statistical methods and a very small cohort of the data used to "prove" the
    connection are deemed dubious enough to invalidate the research. The Harvard researchers
    are stripped of their medical licenses and fired from the university. Research
    into cancer treatment doubles down, though there remains a rift in academia about
    these polyomaviruses'' role in human tumor formation. Many scientists wanting
    to independently research further find difficulty in securing grants and funding.

    in trying to convince (or coerce) folks who lack the HPV vaccine to get vaccinated
    than in trying to convince / coerce folks who lack the MMR vaccine to get vaccinated.
    If society could convince, say, 50% of the folks who don''t have the HPV vaccine
    to get vaccinated and 50% of the folks who don''t have the MMR to get vaccinated,
    the HPV vaccine would save more lives than the MMR. And even though vaccinating
    50% of the unvaccinated would mean vastly more vaccinations with HPV than MMR
    (because most folks already have the MMR vaccine), it would probably be easier
    to accomplish since most of the unvaccinated don''t have some vendetta against
    the vaccine. But hey, if we could get to 99% vaccination rates for both (and TDaP
    and polio), that would be great. Measles and whooping cough and polio *and* cervical

    vaccine to get vaccinated than in trying to convince / coerce folks who lack the
    MMR vaccine to get vaccinated. If society could convince, say, 50% of the folks
    who don''t have the HPV vaccine to get vaccinated and 50% of the folks who don''t
    have the MMR to get vaccinated, the HPV vaccine would save more lives than the
    MMR. And even though vaccinating 50% of the unvaccinated would mean vastly more
    vaccinations with HPV than MMR (because most folks already have the MMR vaccine),
    it would probably be easier to accomplish since most of the unvaccinated don''t
    have some vendetta against the vaccine. But hey, if we could get to 99% vaccination
    rates for both (and TDaP and polio), that would be great. Measles and whooping
    cough and polio *and* cervical cancer *all* stink pretty badly. You really don''t
    bother reading posts at all do you? I''ve said several times that both vaccines
    (and the other safe & effective ones) should be pushed. The fallacy that I''ve
    been debating is that HPV is "more dangerous" than measles. Regarding the bolded,
    my first thought is {dunce.gif} Of course increasing the HPV vaccination rate
    would save more lives. A lot less people have been vaccinated for that than for
    MMR. The MMR vaccination percentage is already high, which is exactly the reason
    that there are more HPV related deaths currently. However, based on the mortality
    rates of the different diseases, if the vaccination rates were the same then the
    death count per year from measles would far outstrip the death toll from HPV related
    cancers. I honestly can''t think of any other way to say that measles is more
    deadly than HPV. I''ve tried numbers, I''ve tried words, I even pointed out the
    fact that roughly 240 MILLION Americans are living with HPV and almost none of
    them will die from related issues such as cancer. I guess I could draw a picture,
    maybe... would that work? I know I have some crayons around here somewhere. '

    And water is wet. I still think measles is the more serious and more vaccine-susceptible

    Well that''s a reasonable position to take, but I also think that there should
    be some consideration of which is currently more common. Seeing as how *invasive*
    cervical cancer alone (ignoring other HPV-related cancers as well as non-invasive
    cervical cancer) is roughly 13x more common than measles... I don''t think it''s
    absurd to give it some attention as well. Pap smears were an important first step,
    because early detection does significantly reduce the risk. But prevention via
    vaccination seems pretty logical too. '

    yes, there was a separate big drop prior to that. Two likely reasons: 1) diseases
    mutate over time. Less dealy strains may have become more prevalent. 2) the US
    became much more urban in the 30s. So most kids were exposed to measles when young,

    the older you are when you catch them. '

    My recollection is that the chance of HPV transmission from a single encounter

    certainly lowers that number, but I''m sure it''s still in the double digits.
    Bottom line, the only way to really prevent HPV transmission is to both A) limit
    yourself to a single sexual partner over the course of your lifetime, and pick
    a partner who has done the same *and* B) wash your hands every time you shake
    hands with someone (prior to eating or using the toilet) A tiny percentage of

    The fact that less people died of measles in 2014 than from HPV related cancer
    is only due to the vaccination rate. It sounded like you were saying that HPV
    vaccinations were more important than measles vaccinations, which isn''t true
    because of the lower fatality rate. HPV vaccinations are a bigger issue TODAY
    because of the mortality rate, but that''s only true because of the difference
    between the vaccination rates and the fact that hardly anyone gets measles anymore
    (until the recent introduction of the dumbazz anti-vaxx fad). Also, FWIW, I have
    been agreeing with you that the HPV vaccine should see more use and that it is
    a good thing. I feel that IF the gov''t is going to force MMR & other vaccines
    to be used, then HPV should be included in the list. I just don''t agree with
    your implication (intended or otherwise) that HPV is a more important vaccine
    than the MMR. '

    The HPV vaccine is only supposed to be effective against 4 common strains. Over
    all, I''m sure it provides less protection against "HPV" than the measles vaccine
    provides against "measles". True, although [nitpick]it''s FDA approved for 4 strains,
    but UK studies have shown it to be effective with quite a few more strains that
    don''t have FDA-approval... meaning that the FDA won''t allow Merck to advertise
    "effective against 13 strains of HPV" even though it really is. (Not sure if 13
    is the correct number, but it''s a lot higher than 4 at any rate.) [/nitpick]
    I believe that Gardasil is *extremely* effective against the 4 strains that it
    has FDA approval for, and a bit less effective against quite a few other strains.
    Regardless, I''ve just never heard the term "vaccine-susceptible" before. I''m

    illness. Another big difference is that you can catch measles by being in the
    same room as someone who has it. It doesn''t require sticking your hands in your
    mouth or down your pants to take hold, it just requires you breathing in the same
    general vicinity of someone who is sick. Got proof for the MJ lethality claim?

    Bottom line, the only way to really prevent HPV transmission is to both A) limit
    yourself to a single sexual partner over the course of your lifetime, and pick
    a partner who has done the same *and* B) wash your hands every time you shake
    hands with someone (prior to eating or using the toilet) A tiny percentage of
    Americans do A and an even tinier percentage do B. In business settings B is generally
    not possible. Thinking back to the number of people I met around mealtimes at

  pPost: 'Guys, has the virus responsible for this measles outbreak been isolated
    to identify its geographic origin? Quote: Isolation of measles virus is not recommended
    as a routine method to diagnose measles. However, virus isolates are extremely
    important for molecular epidemiologic surveillance to help determine the geographic
    origin of the virus and the viral strains circulating in the United States. Measles
    virus can be isolated from urine, nasopharyngeal aspirates, heparinized blood,
    or throat swabs. Specimens for virus culture should be obtained from every person
    with a clinically suspected case of measles and should be shipped to the state
    public health laboratory or CDC, at the direction of the state health department.
    Clinical specimens for viral isolation should be collected at the same time as
    samples taken for serologic testing. Because the virus is more likely to be isolated
    when the specimens are collected within 3 days of rash onset, collection of specimens
    for virus isolation should not be delayed until serologic confirmation is obtained.
    Clinical specimens should be obtained within 7 days, and not more than 10 days,
    after rash onset. A detailed protocol for collection of specimens for viral isolation
    is available on the CDC website. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html '

    complicated, and it''s easier to have your opinion spoon fed to you. And then

    for mandating vaccines. There must be cost/benefit analysis. Your simple sound
    bite only serves to highlight your general ignorance and thoughtlessness about
    the subject. So let''s consider the polio vaccine. Polio was once very common.
    In about 0.5% of cases there was muscle weakness. In that subset, some ~3% of
    children would actually die. It was a major deal because polio infected so many
    people. In the 1950s we got the first vaccine. It is highly effective as far as
    vaccines go, where efficacy varies widely based on nature of disease. Today, wild
    poliovirus only exists in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The vaccine has been wildly
    successful. Benefits: large and proven. But what about costs? Well, polio vaccine
    is extraordinarily safe, even as vaccines go. There are some risks: there have
    been several documented cases of vaccine-derived polio outbreaks where people
    vaccinated became infected by the vaccine and spread it to individuals without
    immunity - either from not being vaccinated or from insufficient immune response
    to the vaccine. Additionally, it was discovered during the 1960s that some 10-30
    million polio vaccine recipients had been given a dose contaminated with SV40,
    a cancer causing oncovirus. SV40 appears to have subsequently spread through the
    population both horizontally (person to person) and vertically (mother to child).
    SV40 has been found to be common in various human tumors like osteosarcomas, NH
    lymphomas and more. There is still ongoing research into causal relationship between
    SV40 and human malignancies. It is a point of debate. So, when we properly consider
    the costs, there are some questions. Worst case, SV40 has resulted in some large
    increase in cancer that trumps benefits of polio eradication. Best case, SV40
    only causes cancer in lab animals as is currently proven, and polio vaccine benefits
    dramatically outweigh any costs. Either way, pro-vaxxers generally torpedo their
    own credibility by failing to fully understand the subject while being so sure
    that they are right about it. Then, they criticize anti-vaxxers for their lack
    of understanding on the subject. It''s great comedy. You''ll notice this pattern
    in culture too. Dumb people are so certain of everything while smart people recognize
    nuance and uncertainty. '

    Pro-vaxxers are almost as bad as anti-vaxxers. Clearly efficacy alone cannot be
    justification for mandating vaccines. There must be cost/benefit analysis. Your
    simple sound bite only serves to highlight your general ignorance and thoughtlessness
    about the subject. So let''s consider the polio vaccine. Polio was once very common.
    In about 0.5% of cases there was muscle weakness. In that subset, some ~3% of
    children would actually die. It was a major deal because polio infected so many
    people. In the 1950s we got the first vaccine. It is highly effective as far as
    vaccines go, where efficacy varies widely based on nature of disease. Today, wild
    poliovirus only exists in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The vaccine has been wildly
    successful. Benefits: large and proven. But what about costs? Well, polio vaccine
    is extraordinarily safe, even as vaccines go. There are some risks: there have
    been several documented cases of vaccine-derived polio outbreaks where people
    vaccinated became infected by the vaccine and spread it to individuals without
    immunity - either from not being vaccinated or from insufficient immune response
    to the vaccine. Additionally, it was discovered during the 1960s that some 10-30
    million polio vaccine recipients had been given a dose contaminated with SV40,
    a cancer causing oncovirus. SV40 appears to have subsequently spread through the
    population both horizontally (person to person) and vertically (mother to child).
    SV40 has been found to be common in various human tumors like osteosarcomas, NH
    lymphomas and more. There is still ongoing research into causal relationship between
    SV40 and human malignancies. It is a point of debate. So, when we properly consider
    the costs, there are some questions. Worst case, SV40 has resulted in some large
    increase in cancer that trumps benefits of polio eradication. Best case, SV40
    only causes cancer in lab animals as is currently proven, and polio vaccine benefits
    dramatically outweigh any costs. Either way, pro-vaxxers generally torpedo their
    own credibility by failing to fully understand the subject while being so sure
    that they are right about it. Then, they criticize anti-vaxxers for their lack
    of understanding on the subject. It''s great comedy. You''ll notice this pattern
    in culture too. Dumb people are so certain of everything while smart people recognize
    nuance and uncertainty. Wait, so because some vaccines in the 1960s were contaminated
    with a substance that may or may not cause cancer in humans, we shouldn''t vaccinate
    now in 2016? That sounds logical. '

    No, herd immunity is not a right. Take your entitlement attitude to some socialist
    country. Herd immunity is also a global phenomenon which makes your post nonsense.
    If you really want herd immunity, you need to mandate vaccination globally. Why
    do you think we have measles outbreaks in the US? Do you think some anti-vaxxer
    kid stumbles into the woods and catches wild measles? No, measles hasn''t been
    endemic in the US for nearly two decades. Every case is imported from some "anti-vaxxer"
    country. A right? No. You want shit for free, like a socialist. Are you gonna
    pay to vaccinate the world? Nope. You''ll just force it on everyone in this country
    because it is your right to be an idiot and not fully understand the issue. Like
    my rights to swing my fist end at your face, your rights to be an ignorant douchebag
    end when they seek to trample my rights. Look, my kids are fully vaccinated, but
    I''m not going to let some idiot kid like you take away my fundamental right to
    make my family''s medical decisions. You are advocating an absolutely tyrannical
    situation: a government compelling a population to actively undergo arbitrary
    medical treatments. Could my kid get rubella and die? Yep. That''s life. They''re
    vaccinated but that''s not 100% effective. I chose to get the vaccine but not
    everyone chooses that. That''s their right. A right you want to trample with some
    invented communal "right" to herd immunity, a concept that is historically recent.
    But ya it''s some fundamental "right." It''s not even your right to GET vaccinated,
    but you think it''s your right for everyone else to be vaccinated? Take your childish
    logic and commie bullshit where it''s wanted. You have a wide variety to choose
    from in Europe. Enjoy!! '

    whether those stories were accurate. I don&#8217;t mean in the sense that I&#8217;d

    been asking the right people the right questions, and that&#8217;s leading me
    to write stories that are factually correct, but don&#8217;t accurately reflect
    what&#8217;s really happening. What if scientists are wrong about the reasons
    parents don&#8217;t vaccinate? What if, as a journalist, I&#8217;ve been steering
