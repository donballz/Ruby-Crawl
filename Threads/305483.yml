    I think the size of the "angry conservative" voting bloc this year pretty much

    his electability would hinge on how well he controls his message. A lot of people
    don''t know this outside Ohio, but he has a bit of a temper and has made a few

    I don''t know how many of those videos might be floating around out there, and

    Fair points. Well made. However, I disagree with most of what you wrote. Ronald
    Reagan expanded Medicaid five times. You can expand Medicaid and still be anti-Obamacare.
    As most of us here know, the Medicaid expansion was a fraction of the PPACA. Plus,
    there was a ton of (free to Ohio) federal money on the table. I think he can survive
    that. In fact, while it certainly doesn''t help him with the GOP, expanding Medicaid
    likely helps him a good bit in the general election. Moving to the center is not
    a liability in the general. Poli Sci 101 dictates that one move to the center
    away from the base in a general election. Nobody on the far right is going to
    vote for Hillary/Bernie instead of Kasich or vice versa. It''s a two party system--and
    it''s a race for the swing voters in the swing states, just like it''s always
    been. I don''t understand what you''re talking about re: nuanced vs. clear choice.
    I think maybe you''re trying too hard? As far as Kasich not being dissimilar to
    Romney. I agree. And, while I do think Kasich''s (significantly longer) record
    is more impressive than Romney''s, I''m not certain he has to be too much different.
    Romney was running against the political tour de force of incumbent Obama. (Hillary/Bernie
    are (obviously!) not Obama.. that''s self-evident.) Romney was within 5 points
    of Obama in the general while McCain was blown out by more than 10 points. I don''t
    think those results indicate Romney was a terrible choice. In retrospect, I don''t
    know that any living politician could have unseated Obama in 2012. Re: Gore and
    Edwards not winning their home states Those aren''t exactly swing states! It''s
    apples and oranges. Kasich is beloved in Ohio. Even in liberal stalwart Cuyahoga
    County, he crushed his Democratic rival when he was running for governor. And,
    if you look at the electoral college map, I don''t see that a GOP is going to
    win the election without BOTH Ohio AND Florida. Kasich doesn''t have to be the
    nominee, but he should definitely be on the ticket. '

    may have been good for Ohio but its hard to paint yourself as opponent to legislation
    when you helped implement one of its key components. Medicaid for able bodied
    individuals under 133% of federal poverty level is a key component of Obamacare.
    "The opposition to [Obamacare] was really either political or ideological," Ohio
    Gov. John Kasich (R) told the Associated Press earlier this month. "I don''t think
    that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people''s
    lives." He also summarily dismissed the idea that a Republican-controlled Senate
    would repeal the program.[b] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/...care-big-time/
    The article says he walked back the comments. I don''t have a problem with him
    choosing to do this in his state, but its hard to paint him as a leader of opposition
    if you''re signing onto and helped implement arguably the most liberal component
    of Obamacare. Quote: I really don''t think he is a "move to the middle kinda guy",
    which is why he''s so appealing. I think he''s a conservative but you kinda know
    where he stands. But, he''s taking a huge risk by trying to sound like a rational
    human being in the Republican primaries. Do a lot of Americans know where he stands?
    He supported the Iraq War, but now opposes it because there were no weapons of
    mass destruction. Hardly different from Hillary Clinton. I seem to recall him
    justifying the war in the last debate. Where does he actually stand or does he
    want to forget about it? Do lot of people know that he supports bank bailouts
    and was an executive at Lehman Brothers until the ship went down? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJg66eMLosk
    It seems like it would be very easy to paint him like a Mitt Romney or John Kerry
    figure in this election. '

    of a popular governor. No way Kasich joins Trump. I am biased as I have wanted
    Kasich to run since 2000 and have given money to his campaign on multiple occasions.

    the swing voters in the swing states, just like it''s always been. I don''t understand
    what you''re talking about re: nuanced vs. clear choice. I think maybe you''re
    trying too hard? Yes, in general you have to win moderates, independents, centrists,
    etc. You also have to make sure your base actually still comes to the polls and
    is convinced you''re clear choice against opposition. Is Kasich really a clear
    choice against Hillary? Watch him on The View starting at 6:40 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xL_ZNrZwlY
    He is ''for traditional marriage'' but ''accepts gay marriage'' and went to gay
    wedding. What are his core values? Social issues don''t matter as much in general
    election, but here''s the problem" Hillary Clinton will condemn him for his position
    being problematic for advancing gay right or civil rights. This will mobilize
    the left. Some on the right will feel apathetic at Kasich''s nuanced position.
    How does his nuanced position even translate to policy? Kasich then risks being
    put in position where has to apologize for his beliefs, making himself an easy
    punching bag. Quote: Re: Gore and Edwards not winning their home states Those
    aren''t exactly swing states! It''s apples and oranges. Kasich is beloved in Ohio.
    Even in liberal stalwart Cuyahoga County, he crushed his Democratic rival when
    he was running for governor. And, if you look at the electoral college map, I
    don''t see that a GOP is going to win the election without BOTH Ohio AND Florida.
    Kasich doesn''t have to be the nominee, but he should definitely be on the ticket.
    I don''t agree that he should "definitely" be on the ticket, but he can on the
    list of possible VP. He does bring DC budget experience and could reinforce the
    common man motif on a Trump ticket. That experience is more important than simply
    being from Ohio. I think I''d prefer him in Cabinet position. '

    is spending the day of South Carolina''s Republican primary campaigning and raising

    on Saturday evening to await the primary results after earlier events in Massachusetts,

    Boston and a town hall meeting in Worcester. Massachusetts is one of just a few

    alongside Vermont and Minnesota, are seen as more favorable territory for Kasich
    than South Carolina and a string of Southern states voting on March 1. Well that''s

    Seems like a dumb move. Trump would get himself impeached guaranteed. He''s almost
    doomed to pick someone even dumber than himself, just to protect himself Having
    a VP thats more popular than you is not a recipe for job security. Unfortunately
    for Trump, its almost impossible to find a Republican less popular than he is. '

    I''d add the small comment that managing DOD budgets in Congress is not really
    the same as foreign policy strategic and tactical planning, but that''s still
    very valuable foreign policy-related experience. It would be great if he could
    tie budget related decisions to actual military decisions on the campaign trail.
    I think I''m now 90% sold on him being top VP pick for Trump. '

    Or he can use it to pay himself back if he donated to his own campaign. On the
    other hand, Right to Rise can literally do anything they want. They can give the
    money back, they can pocket it, they can start supporting some other cause or

    The SuperPAC can use the money to attack Trump and build up Kasich. Effectively,
    they can become the SuperPAC for Kasich, if they so choose. They can''t write
    him a check, but they can spend in a way that directly benefits him, the same
    rules they followed before when they were a "pro-Bush" SuperPAC, for example. '

  pPost: 'No idea where the money will go. Somewhere. Upshot has an article (it''s
    my last free one of the month) saying pretty much what I have posted a few times
    here: more candidates need to drop out in order to defeat Trump. This one focuses
    on Rubio v Kasich game theory. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/up...ml?rref=upshot
    For those who have used up their allotment of NYT articles: Spoiler: The Republican
    establishment has a problem. It is headed for a car crash. With Jeb Bush out of
    the Republican presidential race, the two remaining mainstream candidates &#8212;
    Marco Rubio and John Kasich &#8212; are living out an issue studied for decades
    in game theory. Game theorists might call the G.O.P. predicament an anti-coordination
    game or even a volunteer&#8217;s dilemma. But most of us might call it by a more
    familiar name: chicken. Although Mr. Rubio is the obvious establishment favorite,
    leading Mr. Kasich in national polls, prediction markets and delegate math, the
    two are splitting some votes. To have his best chance against Donald Trump and
    Ted Cruz, Mr. Rubio needs Mr. Kasich to drop out. The longer both candidates remain
    in the race, the worse it is for both of them. It&#8217;s safe to assume neither
    would like to see Mr. Trump get the nomination. Continue reading the main story
    Related Coverage The 2016 Race: How Donald Trump Won Twice in One Night In &#8220;An
    Essay on Bargaining,&#8221; a classic paper from 1956, Thomas Schelling lays out
    several strategies that may be useful for both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio. Here,
    we focus on three: commitment, promises and threats. As Richard Thaler, the behavioral
    economist at the University of Chicago, explained, the strategies can be applied
    to anything: health care, nuclear deterrence, the last piece of pizza. Mr. Kasich&#8217;s
    first option, of course, is to stay in the race. But he could go further, by committing
    to stay in no matter what. In a classic game of chicken between two drivers rushing
    headlong toward each other, this strategy is like removing your steering wheel,
    leaving you no choice but to drive straight toward your opponent. Mr. Kasich could
    defend this choice by pointing to his obstacle-strewn but possible path to the
    nomination. He might point out that only a tiny fraction of Republican delegates
    have been allocated; he might note that he could pick up many of Mr. Bush&#8217;s
    voters; he could hope for another robotic debate performance from Mr. Rubio or
    even an implosion from the Trump or Cruz campaigns. This series of events is unlikely,
    of course. It doesn&#8217;t matter how long Mr. Kasich actually intends to stay
    in the race. All that matters is whether Mr. Rubio believes he will do so. (If
    you&#8217;re going to remove your steering wheel, make sure the other driver sees
    you do it!) The more believable the commitment, the stronger his negotiating position
    for the far more effective strategy in brinkmanship games: cutting a deal. Side
    deals, bargains or promises are the way negotiations actually get done. In a 1984
    paper on the public supply of a private good, the economists Christopher Bliss
    and Barry Nalebuff wrote that &#8220;binding agreements combined with side payments
    can always produce a superior outcome&#8221; to brinkmanship. Some deals are obvious;
    the best such deal would be a spot on the presidential ticket, which Mr. Rubio
    could offer Mr. Kasich in exchange for dropping out &#8212; provided he becomes
    the nominee, of course. (A simple Google search of &#8220;Rubio Kasich side deals&#8221;
    produces no shortage of opinions on the matter.) Advertisement Continue reading
    the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are other potential
    promises. It might take the form of a concession on another matter &#8212; Mr.
    Rubio could promise to adopt or address some of Mr. Kasich&#8217;s issues, which
    would allow Mr. Kasich to end his campaign and claim a small victory. In the book
    &#8220;Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma,&#8221; William Poundstone suggests that the best
    solution to a game of chicken is one that allows the losing party to give in while
    still &#8220;saving face.&#8221; He noted its role in bringing a peaceful end
    to the Cuban missile crisis. Regardless of the details, the quality of the deal
    depends on how much a Kasich exit matters to Mr. Rubio. The more crucial his exit,
    the stronger any promise is sure to be. There is a third strategy available to
    Mr. Kasich, which takes the form of threats. Here, Mr. Kasich might insist on
    a promise or concession from Mr. Rubio; if he doesn&#8217;t get it, he could threaten
    to support a different candidate, like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz. That move wouldn&#8217;t
    serve shared establishment interests, but if the threat had the potential to damage
    Mr. Rubio enough, it could be a useful bargaining chip. &#8220;Being crazy is
    a strategy, but only if your opponent actually believes it,&#8221; Mr. Thaler
    said. Of the three strategies described here, this seems least likely. Two external
    factors complicate this matter further. Part of the reason this dilemma exists
    in the first place is that mainstream Republicans lack the unity or influence
    to compel any cooperation. After the New Hampshire primary, one Republican likened
    the battle among mainstream candidates to a hockey fight: &#8220;The gloves are
    off and the refs can&#8217;t get in the middle of it.&#8221; That&#8217;s exactly
    right. If establishment Republicans had a clear, unimpeachable leader who was
    not a participant in the race, that person might be able to compel a candidate
    to drop out and support whomever the party determined to be strongest, allowing
    candidates who quit to save face by saying they did it for &#8220;the good of
    the party.&#8221; At the moment, no such leader exists for mainstream Republicans,
    resulting in a tragedy of the commons-like failure of collective action. Second,
    this is a game that&#8217;s played just once. The chance to be your party&#8217;s
    nominee for president comes along only every four or eight years, even for the
    very luckiest candidates. If the candidates lived in a universe in which they
    could run for president hundreds of times, they might agree that, on average,
    their shared interests were better served by cooperating. Once in a while, Mr.
    Kasich might try to win the contest outright against long odds, but, on average,
    he would probably agree that cooperating, including alternating victories, was
    the best way to serve his and Mr. Rubio&#8217;s shared interests. Game theory
    shows that in iterated dilemmas, played many hundreds or thousands of times, cooperation
    is a very stable strategy &#8212; one reason it is so common in nature. But this
    is not an iterated dilemma. It&#8217;s a one-time-only dilemma with a tremendous
    payoff for the winner. As much as Mr. Kasich might think about his legacy, the
    good of the party or even his own chances in 2020 or 2024, the future is very
    far away. Ultimately, they risk an outcome neither he nor Mr. Rubio wants. As
    Daniel Diermeier, the dean of the public policy school at the University of Chicago,
    notes, &#8220;A very important lesson of game theory is that sometimes the world
    is a grim place.&#8221; '

    It sounds very bad without context but he was talking about public servants being
    dicks. In context, he''s not saying "How dare you treat me, the governor, that

    Lololololol. I''m with dear Swimmer, again here, that the difference between Trump
    and Kasich is that Kasich is "Christ-like". That is, like-Christ, he repeatedly
    dumps on his own team instead of on everyone else. We should crucify him. '

    run into several Republicans (Democrats too for that matter) who seriously thought
    that Trump had more than 50% of the delegates assigned so far, so from what I
    can tell, that is a somewhat common misperception. Nothing wrong with clearing
    that up IMO although obviously Trump is ahead of all his competitors in terms
    of both delegate count and overall [primary] popular vote and to suggest otherwise
    is foolish and wrong. '

    He''s saying that a Republican, even a fake Republican like Donald Trump, is not
    going to win NY unless there is a massive nationwide landslide. From 1960-present
    NY has voted Republican 3 times: 1984 - landslide election (525 - 13) 1980 - landslide
    election (489 - 49) 1972 - landslide election (520* - 17) So if it takes the Republicans
    getting 450+ EVs before NY turns Republican, then AO fan''s vote doesn''t really
    matter. *Nixon lost one EV to a faithless elector. '

    Tennessee&#8212; Many of the 49 delegates in Tennessee who are pledged to either
    Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)97% will reportedly meet this month to seal
    a grassroots alliance in which they pledge their votes during any contested convention
    only to Trump or Cruz. &#8220;My concern is that whether you are a Cruz delegate
    or a Trump delegate the establishment wants to nominate somebody like John Kasich
    who has no mathematical chance or moral authority to become the nominee because
    he has received so few votes in the primaries,&#8221; former State Rep. Joe Carr,
    an at-large Cruz delegate, tells Breitbart News. He adds: As a result of this
    flagrant attempt at hijacking the process, I have contacted several of the Tennessee
    Trump and Cruz delegates in an effort to band together with the goal of making
    sure that the duly elected delegates have their voices heard according to current
    RNC Convention Rules. If the establishment persists in their recklessness attempt
    to steal the nomination from either Donald Trump or Senator Cruz, the Republican
    Party may not recover for a generation. Others are also speaking out. &#8220;I
    am concerned about the future of our country and I believe a brokered convention
    will only mean that Hillary will win,&#8221; State Senator Mae Beavers (R-Mt.
    Juliet), an at-large Trump delegate, tells Breitbart News. &#8220;It&#8217;s time
    we all honor our commitment to the process and to the people who elected us. I
    will do whatever I can to work with all delegates to make sure that is done,&#8221;
    Beavers adds. Carr and former Nashville talk radio host Steve Gill, also a Cruz
    delegate, intend to meet Trump delegate Beavers today to discuss the details of
    a bigger meeting next week to which all Trump and Cruz delegates elected in the
    March 1 Tennessee primary will be invited. They tell Breitbart News they plan
    on pledging that their votes at the Republican National Convention will be for
    one of the two anti-establishment candidates, Trump or Cruz, on every ballot cast
    after their legal obligation to vote for the candidate for whom they pledged their
    commitment. The two outsider candidates have won more than 77 percent of all the
    Republican convention delegates selected in the state primaries and caucuses to
    date. '

    very different interests and goals fighting for control of the party. Trump, Cruz
    and Kasich represent different factions. There is no unity candidate. Cruz represents
    the Tea Party faction, which has no interest in governing. Trump represents the

    to offer a conservative "get things done" option. The other "get things done"
    candidates dropped out of the race a while ago. I have also been disenfranchised
    by the Republican party. Despite having conservative leanings on a range of issues,
    the party has been under control of the social issues faction most of my adult

    Maybe even a second vote after the release of delegates to see if anybody gets

    Very selfish. my guess is that most people who run for president are somewhat

    My preference is approval voting. It''s been mathematically proven that all voting
    systems are broken, and sometimes produce bad results. But if you look at the
    details, our system breaks more often in realistic scenarios than pretty much
    any other system that''s been proposed. In approval voting, each voter votes for
    as many or as few candidate as they like. They can vote for zero, or all of them.
    The idea is that you vote for everyone you approve of. Whoever gets the most votes
    wins. In some variations, if no one gets a majority of the votes, you drop the
    least popular and re-vote, continuing until someone has a majority. (Note that
    if there are several attractive candidates, several of them could each have a
    majority.) That is better, but less practical. The virtues of approval voting
    are that it is simple, easy to understand and implement, avoids situations where
    two similar popular candidates split the vote in a way that leads to a less popular
    (overall) candidate winning, and generally favors candidates who are widely acceptable.
    Which seems like a good thing. A side effect is that since everyone is free to
    vote for their favorite candidate as well as the guy who is good enough, if there
    is a lot of support for, say, the libertarian or green candidate, you will see
    that in the vote tally even if those candidates don''t win, and politicians can
    react to that sort of voter preference, or candidates leaning that way can toss
    their hat in the race next time. '

    Kasich is not a consensus between other candidates no matter how anyone dreams
    to spin it. Dude there was like 27 people in the race in January. I can prove
    that the great majority of Cruz supporters would support Kasich in a head to head
    against Trump. http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/m...-primary-2016/ Quote: Rubio
    voters move to Kasich 75/16 over Trump, Cruz voters do so 69/25, and undecideds
    would pick him 54/11 if Kasich and Trump ended up being the two candidates they
    chose between. Kasich is also by far the most broadly popular of the candidates
    in Ohio with a 70/22 favorability rating- only Trump at 48/44 is also on positive
    ground among the remaining candidates '

    Voila! I think it is fair, presumably, the plurality candidates have an advantage
    with their previous pledged candidates. I think though even Kasich has a chance.
    Who do the Trump people delegates vote for in round 1? They might support their
    second choice (presumably Cruz) or they might support Kasich to eliminate Cruz.
    Then the final round determines whether Trump has a majority if you include second
    choice votes. Everybody should be happy - very democratic process. I''d like this
    if I thought that the Trump supporters would vote for their true second choice
    in round 1. As it is, I think they''d vote for whomever is more likely to lose
    to Trump in round 2. But I can''t think of a way to prevent that from happening,

  pPost: 'Poll: Trump beats both foes head-to-head The results indicate that unifying
    Republican opposition to Donald Trump would be very hard. By NICK GASS 03/23/16
    06:00 AM EDT Donald Trump would lead either Ted Cruz or John Kasich in a two-way
    race, according to the results of a Quinnipiac University national poll released
    Wednesday. Asked whom they would like to win the GOP nomination, 43 percent of
    the 652 Republicans surveyed said they wanted Trump to emerge as the party''s
    choice in Cleveland, followed by 29 percent for Cruz and just 16 percent for Kasich,
    with 9 percent undecided. In a head-to-head matchup between Trump and Cruz &#8212;
    with Kasich voters re-allocated to their second choices &#8212; the Manhattan
    real-estate mogul earned 46 percent support, compared with 37 percent for Cruz
    and 12 percent undecided. While the Texas senator drew slim advantages among tea
    party supporters, white, born-again evangelicals and those describing themselves
    as very conservative, Trump drew far greater support from voters who described
    themselves as somewhat conservative, moderate or liberal, as well as among men,
    women and those 45 years and older. With Cruz supporters shifting to their second
    choices, Trump would have a large lead. Fifty-six percent said they would vote
    for Trump, with just 25 percent opting for Kasich and 13 percent undecided. More
    than seven-in-10 (71 percent) of tea party supporters said they would vote for
    Trump over the Ohio governor, along with strong majorities in every demographic
    and ideological group, including those describing themselves as moderate or liberal.
    On the Democratic side of the race, 50 percent said they would prefer Hillary
    Clinton as their party''s nominee, while 38 percent wanted Bernie Sanders and
    10 percent did not know. http://www.politico.com/story/2016/0...-kasich-221111 '

    (No one else has a chance at this point, right?) The 755 Trump has right now are
    bound to him, at least on 1st ballot. Of the remaining states, you get interesting
    rules like: New York: 14 at large, 81 Congressional delegates. The winner takes
    all if over 50%, but if not, the at large are allocated pro-rata to those with
    at least 20% of the vote, and each congressional district is winner take all.
    Pennsylvania: 17 at large, 54 congressional. Winner takes all 17, but the 54 congressional
    people can vote for whoever they want -- votes are merely an FYI for the delegate.
    Colorado: There isn''t even a primary or a caucus. The delegates coalesce up from
    whatever convention to county convention to state convention, then they somehow
    get elected and somehow declare who they want to vote for. Not sure if you would
    expect Trump to get any of these (I counted him at 0), any more than 0 is gravy.
    So, the stated delegates are bound to whom the voters say they are. The exceptions
    are Colorado, Pennsylvania''s congressional voters, and for some reason, 3 delegates
    from each of Connecticut, Oregon, and Nebraska. '

    Also, who the heck ARE those delegates? How did they get chosen? Did Trump''s
    Missouri campaign manager choose them or did the Missouri Republican Party leadership
    (presumably a bit more pro-establishment than Trump''s campaign manager) choose
    them? That is the question. So to answer that question for Missouri... Delegates
    are bound on first ballot only (pretty common, but not universal). 3 delegates
    are the RNC delegates (true for every state). Then on April 9, registered Republicans
    caucus to determine who gets to go to the district and state conventions. One
    would assume that there is extremely low turnout at these caucuses, so they''re
    mostly going to be choosing party insiders in all likelihood. April 30, 24 delegates
    are determined at the district conventions (3 delegates x 8 districts). Again,
    presuming that these are party insiders. May 20-21, 25 delegates are determined
    at the state convention. Once again, we can presume these are party insiders.
    3 + 24 + 25 = 52, which is Missouri''s total delegate count. So for Missouri''s
    52 delegates, one would presume they do not necessarily support the candidate
    to whom they are bound on the first ballot. They are more likely to go for an
    establishment candidate on subsequent ballots. But I do know that in at least
    a few states, the candidates themselves approve the delegates, and as such, the
    delegates are more likely to be campaign volunteers and donors and people who
    truly do support the candidates to whom they are bound. '

    If their candidate is not in last place, they remain bound. So different rules
    on how long they are bound. In Alabama, the delegates declare which candidate
    they support in 2015 and their names appear on the ballot underneath the candidate
    they support. When you vote for the Presidential candidate, you also vote for
    a delegate. So one *presumes* that if you were running as a Trump delegate, that
    you actually support Trump, but that''s not necessarily true. The Alabama delegates
    are bound until one of the following happens: 1) the candidate releases them in
    writing or by public statement 2) at least 2/3 of the Alabama delegates pledged
    to that candidate vote to release themselves In California the presidential candidate
    himself chooses the delegates. They are likely to be true supporters of their
    candidate as the candidate is going to choose campaign volunteers and donors.
    Not doing this for all 56 states & territories today, but you get the idea. As
    the convention gets closer if it''s looking like no one will win on the first
    ballot, I''ll think about putting something together. '

    Obamacare is the only one you listed that is opposed by the public, and most of
    that is propaganda driven - if you ask about the specific provisions of the bill,
    everyone loves it, but when you call it "Obamacare," everyone hates it. Hell,
    most people support the public option when healthcare reform was going through,
    and Obamacare is demonstrably to the right of a public option. Washington DC is

    I''m not so sure it''s that simple. A public option standing beside a market with
    far fewer restrictions and coverage mandates might fairly be described as less

    not so much a left/right thing at this point. Blurred lines. '

    You could, ya know, look at the massive public support for gay marriage. If DC
    wasn''t so far right, I could''ve smoked pot at a gay wedding long ago. How long
    do you think it would have taken for the Congress to legalize gay marriage? I

    ''support gay marriage'' ''wants Washington DC to pass a federal law'' please
    provide some support. We have a federalist government with separation of powers
    and some powers given to state and that federal government requires supermajorities
    in some instances not to allow 50%+1 dominate the 49%. We also have a process
    for writing bills, screening bills, sponsoring, and then voting on them. It''s
    not a simple opinion poll by some polling firm. according to Pew, 2014 is first
    time majority of those polled actually favor only time I see the issue surpassing
    the 50% mark in public poll. http://www.pewforum.org/2015/07/29/g...-gay-marriage/
    Are you really suggesting Washington DC needs to get involved immediately as some
    polling firm says 51% of public support something? Really? '

    Quote: DIVISION OVER COURT CASE Altogether, 39 percent approved of the high court&#8217;s
    decision and 41 percent disapproved. An additional 18 percent neither approved
    nor disapproved. Poll respondents were divided over allowing same-sex marriage
    in their own state, with 42 percent in favor and 40 percent opposed. The poll
    found no surge in support for same-sex marriage since the court&#8217;s ruling
    June 26. If anything, support was down slightly since April, when 48 percent said
    they were in favor in another AP-GfK survey. An earlier poll, conducted in January
    and February, found 44 percent in support of same-sex marriage. A NEW BATTLEGROUND
    As marriage rights for gay couples become settled law, divisions exist over how
    the law should handle those who have religious objections to same-sex marriage.
    When the two are in conflict, 56 percent of those questioned said it&#8217;s more
    important for the government to protect religious liberties, while 39 percent
    said it&#8217;s more important to protect the rights of gays and lesbians. People
    were split over whether officials who issue marriage licenses should be allowed
    to say no to gay and lesbian couples because of religious objections. Just under
    half said those officials should not have to issue the licenses, about the same
    proportion saying they should. Also, 59 percent think wedding-related businesses
    should be allowed to refuse service to same-sex couples, compared with 52 percent
    in the earlier poll. By comparison, 46 percent said businesses in general should
    be allowed to refuse service because of their religious principles, while 51 percent
    said that should not be allowed. '

    Your argument seems to be that, even if the people are to the left of the Congress
    on an issue, the simple act of taking action or not taking action on that issue
    makes the Congress more liberal. The governing, in and of itself, is more liberal
    than the population. You set up a scenario in which everything the government
    does is, by your definition, more liberal than the people. Everyone supports gay
    marriage and wants a federal law allowing gay marriage? If the government gives
    the people that law, you are claiming that they are more liberal than the people???
    That''s nonsense. For example, 58% of people support single-payer healthcare.
    Do you think 58% of Congress support single-payer? And if so, where can I get
    some of the drugs you''re smoking? Drugs, might I add, that most people want legalized,
    and yet are illegal by federal mandate, because Washington DC is demonstrably

    you pretty well need to win the nomination for your seat. How do you do that if
    you are a republican? You move to the right so that you appeal to your "base"
    nominating people and nobody can step in to your seat from the right. Since congress
    has more Republicans than Democrats, this law won''t get passed. it''s too easy
    to point to as an attack point, particularly in the VERY safe Republican seats.
    Those holding those seats have no desire to give a challenger a place to attack

    The Federal Gov''t can''t have their cake and eat it too, they opened the door
    with DOMA. They can''t complain now, the SC did it''s job exactly as it was supposed
    to, ruled on a Federal Law. Because of this I don''t think looking at how many
    people agree with a ruling is the same as how many people like the ruling in perfect
    correlation. Nor do I think that looking at how many people think marriage should
    be a Federal issue vs. a State issue says much about how many people support gay
    marriage. Phone post? Anyhow, it''s a long established principle that the States
    respect marriages performed in other states. That''s different from what marriages
    are allowed in a state. Cousin marriage is the usual example. It''s also established
    that the federal govt respects the marriages performed by the States. Doma was
    bad legislation, and overturning it was correct. The only questionable ruling
    was forcing States to marry gays, which was similar to forcing States to marry
    interracial couples. I suppose you could argue either of those rulings on constitutional
    grounds. '

    ballot behavior. I am one of those people who only votes for offices and candidates
    that I am following and know something about. I don''t cast a straight ticket
    and I leave a lot of slots blank. I am guessing most people think they need to
    fill the whole thing out. Do these "new" voters that Trump is supposedly attracting
    cast "straight ticket" votes or do they pick and choose? I wonder how clear cut
    the outcomes of the rest of the races will be based on Trump being at the top
    of the ticket. If a bunch of these voters are independents/moderates or people
    who don''t usually vote, then they may have disgust with the Republican party
    and not vote R for those other offices. And of course, the "extra" voters who
    show up to vote D to "stop Trump" will also hurt the conservatives. Could be a
    very bad year. I wonder what strategies they will put in place to mitigate the
    damage if they end up nominating Trump. '

    much opposite corners of the state. Now if you cherry-picked two locations that
    didn''t have good highways connecting them you could certainly stay in the state
