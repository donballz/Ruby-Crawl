    In an unlikely GE situation, his electability would hinge on how well he controls

    a temper and has made a few gaffes that would hurt him in the GE. See: http://www.cleveland.com/open/index....calls_pol.html
    I don''t know how many of those videos might be floating around out there, and

    Fair points. Well made. However, I disagree with most of what you wrote. Ronald
    Reagan expanded Medicaid five times. You can expand Medicaid and still be anti-Obamacare.
    As most of us here know, the Medicaid expansion was a fraction of the PPACA. Plus,
    there was a ton of (free to Ohio) federal money on the table. I think he can survive
    that. In fact, while it certainly doesn''t help him with the GOP, expanding Medicaid
    likely helps him a good bit in the general election. Moving to the center is not
    a liability in the general. Poli Sci 101 dictates that one move to the center
    away from the base in a general election. Nobody on the far right is going to
    vote for Hillary/Bernie instead of Kasich or vice versa. It''s a two party system--and
    it''s a race for the swing voters in the swing states, just like it''s always
    been. I don''t understand what you''re talking about re: nuanced vs. clear choice.
    I think maybe you''re trying too hard? As far as Kasich not being dissimilar to
    Romney. I agree. And, while I do think Kasich''s (significantly longer) record
    is more impressive than Romney''s, I''m not certain he has to be too much different.
    Romney was running against the political tour de force of incumbent Obama. (Hillary/Bernie
    are (obviously!) not Obama.. that''s self-evident.) Romney was within 5 points
    of Obama in the general while McCain was blown out by more than 10 points. I don''t
    think those results indicate Romney was a terrible choice. In retrospect, I don''t
    know that any living politician could have unseated Obama in 2012. Re: Gore and
    Edwards not winning their home states Those aren''t exactly swing states! It''s
    apples and oranges. Kasich is beloved in Ohio. Even in liberal stalwart Cuyahoga
    County, he crushed his Democratic rival when he was running for governor. And,
    if you look at the electoral college map, I don''t see that a GOP is going to
    win the election without BOTH Ohio AND Florida. Kasich doesn''t have to be the
    nominee, but he should definitely be on the ticket. '

    may have been good for Ohio but its hard to paint yourself as opponent to legislation
    when you helped implement one of its key components. Medicaid for able bodied
    individuals under 133% of federal poverty level is a key component of Obamacare.
    &quot;The opposition to [Obamacare] was really either political or ideological,&quot;
    Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) told the Associated Press earlier this month. &quot;I
    don''t think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements
    in people''s lives.&quot; He also summarily dismissed the idea that a Republican-controlled
    Senate would repeal the program.[b] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/...care-big-time/
    The article says he walked back the comments. I don''t have a problem with him
    choosing to do this in his state, but its hard to paint him as a leader of opposition
    if you''re signing onto and helped implement arguably the most liberal component
    of Obamacare. Quote: I really don''t think he is a &quot;move to the middle kinda

    where he stands? He supported the Iraq War, but now opposes it because there were
    no weapons of mass destruction. Hardly different from Hillary Clinton. I seem
    to recall him justifying the war in the last debate. Where does he actually stand
    or does he want to forget about it? Do lot of people know that he supports bank
    bailouts and was an executive at Lehman Brothers until the ship went down? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJg66eMLosk
    It seems like it would be very easy to paint him like a Mitt Romney or John Kerry

    from deficits to surpluses. I never thought that would happen in my lifetime.
    The people that say he was a 1 state wonder are making things up. Many candidates
    have to do well in either Iowa or NH to get the money to go further. He is set
    for the Midwest states and parts of the south where he has better support. Newt

    beat on that vote. Jeb''s brother is very popular and Marco has the endorsement
    of a popular governor. No way Kasich joins Trump. I am biased as I have wanted
    Kasich to run since 2000 and have given money to his campaign on multiple occasions.
    After SC, a total of 4% of the delegates will be determined. It is a long slog. '

    of the 9 or 10 debates. Quote: Moving to the center is not a liability in the
    general. Poli Sci 101 dictates that one move to the center away from the base
    in a general election. Nobody on the far right is going to vote for Hillary/Bernie
    instead of Kasich or vice versa. It''s a two party system--and it''s a race for
    the swing voters in the swing states, just like it''s always been. I don''t understand
    what you''re talking about re: nuanced vs. clear choice. I think maybe you''re
    trying too hard? Yes, in general you have to win moderates, independents, centrists,
    etc. You also have to make sure your base actually still comes to the polls and
    is convinced you''re clear choice against opposition. Is Kasich really a clear
    choice against Hillary? Watch him on The View starting at 6:40 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xL_ZNrZwlY
    He is ''for traditional marriage'' but ''accepts gay marriage'' and went to gay
    wedding. What are his core values? Social issues don''t matter as much in general
    election, but here''s the problem&quot; Hillary Clinton will condemn him for his
    position being problematic for advancing gay right or civil rights. This will
    mobilize the left. Some on the right will feel apathetic at Kasich''s nuanced
    position. How does his nuanced position even translate to policy? Kasich then
    risks being put in position where has to apologize for his beliefs, making himself
    an easy punching bag. Quote: Re: Gore and Edwards not winning their home states
    Those aren''t exactly swing states! It''s apples and oranges. Kasich is beloved
    in Ohio. Even in liberal stalwart Cuyahoga County, he crushed his Democratic rival
    when he was running for governor. And, if you look at the electoral college map,
    I don''t see that a GOP is going to win the election without BOTH Ohio AND Florida.
    Kasich doesn''t have to be the nominee, but he should definitely be on the ticket.
    I don''t agree that he should &quot;definitely&quot; be on the ticket, but he
    can on the list of possible VP. He does bring DC budget experience and could reinforce
    the common man motif on a Trump ticket. That experience is more important than
    simply being from Ohio. I think I''d prefer him in Cabinet position. '

    is spending the day of South Carolina''s Republican primary campaigning and raising

    on Saturday evening to await the primary results after earlier events in Massachusetts,
    but the schedule is not finalized. Saturday''s events include a fundraiser in
    Boston and a town hall meeting in Worcester. Massachusetts is one of just a few
    northern states holding its primary on Super Tuesday on March 1. The Bay State,
    alongside Vermont and Minnesota, are seen as more favorable territory for Kasich
    than South Carolina and a string of Southern states voting on March 1. Well that''s

    Seems like a dumb move. Trump would get himself impeached guaranteed. He''s almost
    doomed to pick someone even dumber than himself, just to protect himself Having
    a VP thats more popular than you is not a recipe for job security. Unfortunately
    for Trump, its almost impossible to find a Republican less popular than he is. '

    I''d add the small comment that managing DOD budgets in Congress is not really
    the same as foreign policy strategic and tactical planning, but that''s still
    very valuable foreign policy-related experience. It would be great if he could
    tie budget related decisions to actual military decisions on the campaign trail.
    I think I''m now 90% sold on him being top VP pick for Trump. '

    Or he can use it to pay himself back if he donated to his own campaign. On the
    other hand, Right to Rise can literally do anything they want. They can give the
    money back, they can pocket it, they can start supporting some other cause or

    The SuperPAC can use the money to attack Trump and build up Kasich. Effectively,
    they can become the SuperPAC for Kasich, if they so choose. They can''t write
    him a check, but they can spend in a way that directly benefits him, the same
    rules they followed before when they were a &quot;pro-Bush&quot; SuperPAC, for
    example. '

  pPost: 'No idea where the money will go. Somewhere. Upshot has an article (it''s
    my last free one of the month) saying pretty much what I have posted a few times
    here: more candidates need to drop out in order to defeat Trump. This one focuses
    on Rubio v Kasich game theory. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/up...ml?rref=upshot
    For those who have used up their allotment of NYT articles: Spoiler: The Republican
    establishment has a problem. It is headed for a car crash. With Jeb Bush out of
    the Republican presidential race, the two remaining mainstream candidates &#8212;
    Marco Rubio and John Kasich &#8212; are living out an issue studied for decades
    in game theory. Game theorists might call the G.O.P. predicament an anti-coordination
    game or even a volunteer&#8217;s dilemma. But most of us might call it by a more
    familiar name: chicken. Although Mr. Rubio is the obvious establishment favorite,
    leading Mr. Kasich in national polls, prediction markets and delegate math, the
    two are splitting some votes. To have his best chance against Donald Trump and
    Ted Cruz, Mr. Rubio needs Mr. Kasich to drop out. The longer both candidates remain
    in the race, the worse it is for both of them. It&#8217;s safe to assume neither
    would like to see Mr. Trump get the nomination. Continue reading the main story
    Related Coverage The 2016 Race: How Donald Trump Won Twice in One Night In &#8220;An
    Essay on Bargaining,&#8221; a classic paper from 1956, Thomas Schelling lays out
    several strategies that may be useful for both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio. Here,
    we focus on three: commitment, promises and threats. As Richard Thaler, the behavioral
    economist at the University of Chicago, explained, the strategies can be applied
    to anything: health care, nuclear deterrence, the last piece of pizza. Mr. Kasich&#8217;s
    first option, of course, is to stay in the race. But he could go further, by committing
    to stay in no matter what. In a classic game of chicken between two drivers rushing
    headlong toward each other, this strategy is like removing your steering wheel,
    leaving you no choice but to drive straight toward your opponent. Mr. Kasich could
    defend this choice by pointing to his obstacle-strewn but possible path to the
    nomination. He might point out that only a tiny fraction of Republican delegates
    have been allocated; he might note that he could pick up many of Mr. Bush&#8217;s
    voters; he could hope for another robotic debate performance from Mr. Rubio or
    even an implosion from the Trump or Cruz campaigns. This series of events is unlikely,
    of course. It doesn&#8217;t matter how long Mr. Kasich actually intends to stay
    in the race. All that matters is whether Mr. Rubio believes he will do so. (If
    you&#8217;re going to remove your steering wheel, make sure the other driver sees
    you do it!) The more believable the commitment, the stronger his negotiating position
    for the far more effective strategy in brinkmanship games: cutting a deal. Side
    deals, bargains or promises are the way negotiations actually get done. In a 1984
    paper on the public supply of a private good, the economists Christopher Bliss
    and Barry Nalebuff wrote that &#8220;binding agreements combined with side payments
    can always produce a superior outcome&#8221; to brinkmanship. Some deals are obvious;
    the best such deal would be a spot on the presidential ticket, which Mr. Rubio
    could offer Mr. Kasich in exchange for dropping out &#8212; provided he becomes
    the nominee, of course. (A simple Google search of &#8220;Rubio Kasich side deals&#8221;
    produces no shortage of opinions on the matter.) Advertisement Continue reading
    the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are other potential
    promises. It might take the form of a concession on another matter &#8212; Mr.
    Rubio could promise to adopt or address some of Mr. Kasich&#8217;s issues, which
    would allow Mr. Kasich to end his campaign and claim a small victory. In the book
    &#8220;Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma,&#8221; William Poundstone suggests that the best
    solution to a game of chicken is one that allows the losing party to give in while
    still &#8220;saving face.&#8221; He noted its role in bringing a peaceful end
    to the Cuban missile crisis. Regardless of the details, the quality of the deal
    depends on how much a Kasich exit matters to Mr. Rubio. The more crucial his exit,
    the stronger any promise is sure to be. There is a third strategy available to
    Mr. Kasich, which takes the form of threats. Here, Mr. Kasich might insist on
    a promise or concession from Mr. Rubio; if he doesn&#8217;t get it, he could threaten
    to support a different candidate, like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz. That move wouldn&#8217;t
    serve shared establishment interests, but if the threat had the potential to damage
    Mr. Rubio enough, it could be a useful bargaining chip. &#8220;Being crazy is
    a strategy, but only if your opponent actually believes it,&#8221; Mr. Thaler
    said. Of the three strategies described here, this seems least likely. Two external
    factors complicate this matter further. Part of the reason this dilemma exists
    in the first place is that mainstream Republicans lack the unity or influence
    to compel any cooperation. After the New Hampshire primary, one Republican likened
    the battle among mainstream candidates to a hockey fight: &#8220;The gloves are
    off and the refs can&#8217;t get in the middle of it.&#8221; That&#8217;s exactly
    right. If establishment Republicans had a clear, unimpeachable leader who was
    not a participant in the race, that person might be able to compel a candidate
    to drop out and support whomever the party determined to be strongest, allowing
    candidates who quit to save face by saying they did it for &#8220;the good of
    the party.&#8221; At the moment, no such leader exists for mainstream Republicans,
    resulting in a tragedy of the commons-like failure of collective action. Second,
    this is a game that&#8217;s played just once. The chance to be your party&#8217;s
    nominee for president comes along only every four or eight years, even for the
    very luckiest candidates. If the candidates lived in a universe in which they
    could run for president hundreds of times, they might agree that, on average,
    their shared interests were better served by cooperating. Once in a while, Mr.
    Kasich might try to win the contest outright against long odds, but, on average,
    he would probably agree that cooperating, including alternating victories, was
    the best way to serve his and Mr. Rubio&#8217;s shared interests. Game theory
    shows that in iterated dilemmas, played many hundreds or thousands of times, cooperation
    is a very stable strategy &#8212; one reason it is so common in nature. But this
    is not an iterated dilemma. It&#8217;s a one-time-only dilemma with a tremendous
    payoff for the winner. As much as Mr. Kasich might think about his legacy, the
    good of the party or even his own chances in 2020 or 2024, the future is very
    far away. Ultimately, they risk an outcome neither he nor Mr. Rubio wants. As
    Daniel Diermeier, the dean of the public policy school at the University of Chicago,
    notes, &#8220;A very important lesson of game theory is that sometimes the world
    is a grim place.&#8221; '

    It sounds very bad without context but he was talking about public servants being

    Lololololol. I''m with dear Swimmer, again here, that the difference between Trump
    and Kasich is that Kasich is &quot;Christ-like&quot;. That is, like-Christ, he
    repeatedly dumps on his own team instead of on everyone else. We should crucify
    him. '

    Trump won every delegate in South Carolina, but they''re determined by congressional

    in terms of whether Trump can get the nomination on the first ballot at the convention.
    I have actually run into several Republicans (Democrats too for that matter) who
    seriously thought that Trump had more than 50% of the delegates assigned so far,
    so from what I can tell, that is a somewhat common misperception. Nothing wrong
    with clearing that up IMO although obviously Trump is ahead of all his competitors
    in terms of both delegate count and overall [primary] popular vote and to suggest
    otherwise is foolish and wrong. '
