    over the next couple of months&quot; as to whether he will release his tax returns.
    Trump rejected Romney''s accusation out of hand, saying &quot;there is no bombshell
    at all other than I pay a lot of tax and the government wastes the money.&quot;
    And Trump also slammed Romney, whom the real estate mogul endorsed in the 2012
    GOP presidential nominating contest, as &quot;yesterday''s news.&quot; Romney''s
    biting attack hinted at clear signs of alarm in the Republican establishment at
    the billionaire''s tightening grip on the party''s presidential race. '

  pPost: 'Three Republican challengers to Donald Trump all face must-wins in their
    home states Quote: By WILL WEISSERT and SCOTT BAUER, Associated Press AUSTIN,
    Texas (AP) &#8212; In their efforts to derail Donald Trump from the Republican
    presidential nomination, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio
    Gov. John Kasich are all facing enormous pressure in their home state primaries,
    which account for about a fourth of the delegates up for grabs in the next three
    weeks. Failure to defend their turf could leave each explaining what states they
    can win going forward &#8212; and make the New York billionaire look all the more
    inevitable. After Trump''s impressive win in Nevada, the presidential race now
    shifts to a dozen states on Super Tuesday. That includes Texas, with 155 delegates
    &#8212; the biggest prize of any contest that day. Another test looms March 15,
    with primaries in Florida, with 99 delegates, and Ohio with 66 &#8212; those states
    are winner-take-all. If no one can dent Trump''s advantage by then, the race for
    the nomination may be all but over. But home states have buoyed candidates in
    the past. Four years ago, eventual GOP nominee Mitt Romney used his native Michigan
    to quash a surprisingly stout challenge from Rick Santorum. Newt Gingrich won
    his home state of Georgia and neighboring South Carolina but did little elsewhere.
    Of the trio with looming home-state primaries, Cruz may be in the strongest position.
    &quot;I wanna say, I cannot wait to get home to the great state of Texas,&quot;
    Cruz said Tuesday night after losing in Nevada to Trump. &quot;Tonight, I''ll
    sleep in my bed for the first time in a month.&quot; http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/...in-home-states '

    about themselves that are true or not.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;I think we
    have good reason to believe that there&#8217;s a bombshell in Donald Trump&#8217;s

    he&#8217;s not as anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn&#8217;t
    been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay, or perhaps he hasn&#8217;t
    been giving money to the vets, or to the disabled, like he&#8217;s been telling

    there&#8217;s a bombshell in there, is because every time he&#8217;s asked about

    we&#8217;re not talking about the taxes that are coming due this year. Of course
    they&#8217;re working on those. They won&#8217;t be ready for months. We&#8217;re
    talking about taxes already filed, back taxes. And my back taxes, when I ran in
    2012, my back taxes, I put out in January of 2012. We&#8217;re now in late February
    and we still haven&#8217;t seen either Donald Trump&#8217;s, or Marco Rubio&#8217;s,

    returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be.&#8221; '

    told. She made up a story about how she was ducking sniper fire! There was no
    sniper fire. She made it up! How do you forget a thing like that? She said she
    was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, the guy who climbed Mount Everest. He hadn&#8217;t
    even climbed it when she was born! Total lie! She lied about the emails, of course,
    as we all know, and is probably going to be indicted. You know she said there
    were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq! It was a lie! Thousands of American
    soldiers are dead because of her. Not only does she lie, her lies kill people.
    That&#8217;s four lies, I said I&#8217;d give you three. You can&#8217;t even

    she hasn&#8217;t lied. They asked her straight up, she says she usually tries
    to tell the truth! Ooooh, she tries! Come on! This is a person, every single word

    I don''t think it really works like that. Democrats won''t care what Trump says.
    So-called independents will hear just as scathing criticisms of Trump. {shrug.gif}
    Republicans may not even vote for Trump from what my TV tells me. '

    remarks would be considered a severe blow to most candidates for public office.
    Trump has, in the Republican primary, proven largely immune to the backlash that
    the laws of gravity in politics would predict, but there are also suggestions
    that he has a deep problem with some women voters: 68% of women voters held an
    unfavorable view of Trump in a Quinnipiac poll released in December. In a Gallup
    poll also released in December, Trump had the lowest net favorable rating out
    of all the candidates among college-educated Republican women. And should he win
    the nomination, his comments are sure to become ammunition for Democrats against
    what they have long cast as a Republican ******post can''t decode******war on
    women.******post can''t decode****** Trump has a history of making crude remarks
    toward women. He reportedly said of his ex-wife Marla Maples, ******post can''t

    he has called Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly a ******post can''t decode******bimbo******post

    can''t decode****** and said she had ******post can''t decode******blood coming

    The focus of Trump******post can''t decode******s attentions when interviewed
    by Stern was commonly female celebrities ******post can''t decode****** movie
    and television stars, recording artists, models, and media personalities. Trump,
    in more than one instance, expressed his admiration for and attraction to Diana,
    Princess of Wales. Months after Diana was killed in an automobile accident in
    1997, Trump told Stern he thinks he could have slept with her, saying she had
    ******post can''t decode******supermodel beauty.******post can''t decode******
    In a different interview in 2000, Trump said he would have slept with her ******post

    can''t decode****** He added, ******post can''t decode******She was crazy, but

    got a great face. I think her lips are too big, to be honest with you, they look
    like too big.******post can''t decode****** On several different occasions, Trump
    ranked or rated women on their looks. In one instance, Trump ranked his top 10
    most beautiful women, and while his then-girlfriend Melania Knauss took the top
    spot, Trump told Stern he definitely would have sex with Mariah Carey, Cindy Crawford,
    and Princess Diana, who also made the list. In another appearance, Trump assigned
    each of the actors on ABC******post can''t decode******s Desperate Housewives
    a score of 1 to 10 based on their attractiveness. He said of one of the actors,
    Nicollette Sheridan: ******post can''t decode******A person who is very flat-chested

    he asked Stern, ******post can''t decode******Would you go out with Marcia Cross
    or would you turn gay, Howard?******post can''t decode****** In the interviews,
    Stern and his co-hosts often introduced the most vulgar elements into the conversation,
    but Trump was almost always willing to go along. Talking about Pamela Anderson******post

    &#8212; the reason that I think there&#8217;s a bombshell in there, is because
    every time he&#8217;s asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays and says, well,
    we&#8217;re working on it. Hey, we&#8217;re not talking about the taxes that are
    coming due this year. Of course they&#8217;re working on those. They won&#8217;t
    be ready for months. We&#8217;re talking about taxes already filed, back taxes.
    And my back taxes, when I ran in 2012, my back taxes, I put out in January of
    2012. We&#8217;re now in late February and we still haven&#8217;t seen either
    Donald Trump&#8217;s, or Marco Rubio&#8217;s, or Ted Cruz&#8217;s taxes. And frankly
    the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee
    ought to be.&#8221; Romney complaining about Trump''s taxes? You can''t make this
    stuff up. Remember .... Quote: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched
    off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney&#8217;s
    company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn&#8217;t paid any taxes for 10
    years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney
    for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, &quot;His
    poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,&quot; referring to George Romney''s
    decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late
    1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested
    with Bain Capital called his office and said, &quot;Harry, he didn''t pay any
    taxes for 10 years.&quot; http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-me...-him-mitt-rom/
    I can easily believe that the real Trump numbers would be embarrassing for a normal
    politician. But, normal political rules don''t apply to Trump. And the predictable
    Tweet Quote: &#8220;Mitt Romney, who totally blew an election that should have
    been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough
    guy,&#8221; Trump tweeted. '

    immigrants are a physical tangible entity which can be pointed to, whereas something
    like monetary policy or legislation, much of which probably needs to be burned
    to the ground, cannot so easily be identified and called out. I also think looking
    at the groups of people that don''t want to burn it down (we can consider Hillary

    There are much fewer black panthers than there are crazy racists, and most people
    won''t encounter one in their everyday life. Obama also never galvanized black
    panthers to ''come out of hiding'' so to speak. Trump is galvanizing all the crazy
    racists to proudly and openly state their viewpoints rather than sticking to shameful
    hiding, which is what I''d prefer. '

    - Trump will probably win, although Rubio is surging somewhat there. Texas: Most
    delegates of the March 1 states, Cruz is leading Trump 34 to 26% Massachusetts:
    Trump leading 45 to 17.5%. Trump seems to do well in New England. Minnesota: Trump
    up 20.7% to 14.7%, Bush had 10% in the last poll, which was back in January. Not
    sure how this''ll go. Oklahoma: Trump 29.5%, Cruz 22.5%, Rubio 21%. 19% undecided.
    Alabama: No polls this year. Arkansas: Cruz up 27% to Trump and Rubio''s 23%,
    this was from a month ago. Tennessee: No polls this year, most recent one from
    November showing Trump 29%, Carson 25%. Colorado: No polls this year, most recent
    one is from November showing Carson in the lead with 25%, Rubio in second at 19%,
    Trump at 17%. Virginia: Trump 35.7%, Rubio 20.7%, Cruz 16% Alaska: Only one poll
    from early January showing Trump up 28% to Cruz'' 24%. Vermont: Trump up 32% to
    Rubio''s 17%. So, it seems like most states are battlegrounds. Trump had a pretty
    bad performance in the debate, that could affect things. A lot of data is pretty

    Doesn''t follow to me. Bernie has fewer ''insane SJWs'' because people like that
    of voting age don''t really exist. They are like the red Starbucks cup controversy,
    they exist only so that people on ''the other side'' can have an objectively ridiculous

    being ''an insane SJW'' that I would be even remotely upset about if galvanized.
    That behavior is the ideological opposite of win d posts, not the ideological

    to enforce the laws on the books. But he''s tarred a racist for it, which I think

    Carson was able to run this year and garner support without &quot;he''s black&quot;
    even being much of a storyline, which would never have happened if McCain was
    elected instead. I am sure every one here has at least one Facebook friend/relative
    that posts/says extremely stupid racist stuff on a frequent basis. There are a
    lot of them out there, and there will be a lot more if ''their President'' is
    elected. It''s not about ''which type of extreme'' is worse. It''s about who has
    a significant portion of their base being these types of people. FWIW, I don''t
    know if Trump is necessarily ''purposefully'' courting them, but he''s certainly
    not turning them away and I don''t think it matters much whether he''s purposefully
    doing it or not. I didn''t realize Carson was black until i watched part of a

    is an important issue, whether legal or illegal. How could it not be? It matters
    how many people are let into a country and where they come from. Consider for
    example these US population estimates based on various levels of immigration.
    Current policy is roughly the middle line. The simple reality is that the future
    of the country will look radically different under these scenarios. Politically,
    you could argue it''s the most important issue since it determines who decides
    all the other issues. Consider California, which is something of a portent for
    the rest of the country. LAUSD has over half a million students, now about 75%
    Hispanic. Grad rates are lousy as are test scores. http://laschoolreport.com/just-in-la...-on-new-tests/
    Quote from one of the district administrators: Quote: I think we find above all
    our poverty is definitely still an issue for the performance of our students,
    and the acquiring of a second language, our English language learners******post
    can''t decode****** but the gap between our [English language learners] and our
    non-English language learners is still there. Here is an article by a teacher
    from the district. http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhoriz.../warhaftig.htm Quote:
    If LAUSD has largely failed in its core mission - the education of children -
    demographics and the times have changed so rapidly that to succeed would have
    required a miracle. Indeed. Even immigration supporters acknowledge that there
    are a lot of challenges. People aren''t just imagining horrible schools or Mara
    Salvatrucha or the deterioration of the political system or illegals driving with
    no insurance (http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015...al-immigrants/). --- Here''s
    a clip of an LA teacher at a rally explaining that LA is stolen Mexican land.

    My understanding is that there are far fewer (or none at all) Super delegates
    on the Republican side compared to the Democrats. So if Trump wins enough delegates
    from state primaries and caucuses it wouldn''t be possible for the Republican
    establishment to throw him off. However, some people think that he won''t win
    enough delegates and in that case the remaining candidates can band together to
    broker a different winner by pledging their delegates to someone else. And I think
    it is pretty clear the Republican establishment hates him. '

    me &quot;win the republican nomination&quot; means that the governing body (the
    RNC) tells state officials that they are assigning their &quot;reserved&quot;
    ballot space to a specific individual. e.g. &quot;Put Mitt Romney on your ballot
    as the R party presidential candidate&quot;. Parties earn these &quot;reserved&quot;
    spots by getting at least __% of the votes in the prior election. So, it''s impossible
    for the RNC to nominate candidate X, and then say they (the RNC) is going to &quot;run
    someone else&quot;. Of course, it''s possible that candidate X could go to the
    convention with a plurality (but not a majority) of the delegates, and the convention
    could nominate someone else. It''s coneivable that a bunch of individual R''s
    could be so disappointed by the person their convention nominates that they would
    start a write-in campaign for someone else. Practically, I give that 0% chance
    of succeeding. A group of break-away R''s could also try to get on ballots via
    nominating petitions. But, I believe the deadlines for those petitions are before
    the conventions, so they would have to guess that the current front-runner will
    be the eventual nominee. That''s the route Bloomberg would take, and I''ve read
    that the petition window is closing pretty rapidly. '

    with the rules governing the national convention. The delegates will accept/reject

    will come in Cleveland &#8211; just a week before the convention starts on July
    18. That is when the Convention Rules Committee, made up of two delegates from
    each state, will decide upon the rules governing the gathering. That part is complex
    too. The RNC Rules Committee makes recommendations on the convention rules to
    the national party, which then makes recommendations to the Convention Rules Committee,
    which then recommends a slate of rules to the delegates to approve on the first
    day of the convention. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/art...el_129335.html '

    So ignoring the RNC for a sec. Suppose there''s this committee that can make a
    bunch of recommendations, and then some organization decides to adopt (or not

    candidate. Oh, sorry, read to fast. Yeah, there''s no way a party will change
    its rules at the last minute to favor or reject a candidate. Even if it''s legal,
    that would destroy the party. There is a chance for an honest brokered convention
    this year, though. And i don''t think that would destroy anyone. Back in the dark
    ages, each state''s Republican and Democratic parties selected delegates to go
    to the national convention. I''m not sure how the delegates were selected, probably
    a mix of primaries and caucuses. But what matters was which men were selected.
    (And it was overwhelmingly men, maybe only men.) At the convention, the delegates
    would disappear into a smoke-filled room where they collectively selected the
    presidential nominee. They lobbied each other and voted repeatedly until someone
    won a majority of delegates votes, much as the Pope is elected today. Then mass
    media happened, and individual voters felt they knew enough to directly influence
    the selection. And the parties responded by setting rules where the delegates
    are obligated to vote for the person they are pledged to (the person whose name
    you see on the your ballot) on the first convention ballot. Or most of them are,
    anyway. The superdelegates can vote for anyone. Since then, the outcome of the
    convention has been known going into it. The smoke-filled rooms have been replaced
    with lots of lights and cameras and inspirational speaches. The purpose of the
    superdelegates, to date, has been to make sure some fringe candidate didn''t prevent
    an outright majority, so the party could crown it''s candidate at the convention,
    without that messy negotiating. At least, i think that''s the point. But the superdelegates
    don''t like Trump, and anyway, the Republicans don''t have many of them. So if
    Trump doesn''t win a majority of delegates through the primaries, it''s likely
    no one would win a majority on the first ballot. And then the delegates are no
    longer bound to anyone in particular. They could vote for Dick Cheney, if a majority
    of them decided to do so. Unlikely, since i gather the Republican formula for
    allocating delegates favors the front-runner, but possible. I''ve never seen a
    brokered convention. I''d love to see one this year. It would almost certainly
    result in a Republican win, since the delegates would know who they were running
    against and pick someone with that in mind. (And neither dem is popular enough
    to beat a strong candidate.) But it would probably be someone who would be a decent
    president. Which is something i can''t say about Trump, who seems likely to win
    otherwise. '

    Quote: Trump does know who David Duke is, however. In 2000, when he said he would
    not seek the Reform Party nomination, Trump said that the party was too splintered
    to successfully back a presidential candidate. &#8220;As you know, the Reform
    Party has got some pretty big problems,&#8221; Trump said on World News Now in
    2000. &#8220;Not the least of which is Pat Buchanan, David Duke, Fulani, and it&#8217;s
    a problem.&#8221; Trump also wrote in the New York Times, &#8220;Although I am
    totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave
    the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company

    Trump is right: it''s a good quote. It''s also a pretty generic sentiment that
    has been said a thousand ways by a thousand different people - many of them regarded
    as the best of humanity and not vehicles for gotcha character assassination. Trump''s
    twitter ebhavior is going to be studied by marketing and poli sci professors for
    eyars to come - and not for the reasons that are being pushed as headlines today.
    He is doing to them what they have taught themselves to do to candidates in order
    to control the narratives. The &quot;I know nothing about Duke&quot; bit is easily
    defensible via Trump''s enthymeme tactic: that he doesn''t care about or have
    time for a nobody like Duke. What he really means is anybody''s guess as usual.
    It''s Trump. Trying to pin him down on the word choice is a losing tactic. Trump''s
    campaign has already demonstrated this in similar situations more than a few times.

    the endorsement, appearing as though he didn''t know who Duke was. Trump''s previous
    run-ins with David Duke included when he ran for the Reform Party presidential
    nomination in 2000. When Trump ended his campaign, he pointed to Duke as one of
    his key reasons for deciding to leave the race. He unknowingly retweeted one of
    Mussolini''s famous quotes Sunday morning. &quot;Gawker Media Executive Editor
    John Cook expressed some concern that the joke behind the account was far too
    obvious, and wouldn''t trick anyone but a complete idiot,&quot; Alex Pareene wrote
    on Gawker, revealing that they had been behind the stunt. Now the Duke thing was
    due to a bad earpiece, WHAT''S THAT SONNY, SPEAK UP!&quot;. http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-trum...duke-1.3468878
    On Monday, however, he told NBC''s Today that he was given a &quot;very bad earpiece&quot;
    for the interview and that he &quot;disavowed David Duke all weekend long on Facebook
    and on Twitter.&quot; '

    They say they are great at making TV, but I''m the one making TV. I''m making
    great TV. They can''t get enough of me. So they play this clip or that clip and
    I say a lot of stuff. They have these unpaid interns. Slaves, you know? So they
    have their slaves sifting through years fo tape to find these sound bites to try
    to figure out what I''ve said and what I''m saying and then they try to talk to
    me about what I''m saying. Well if you want to talk to me about what I''m saying
    I can do that. I can talk about me. But I''m right here talking to you, so why
    do you have to use these old tapes? I say a lot of stuff, you know? If you want
    to know what I think, just ask me, don''t go digging up ancient history. It''s
    ancient. I have a lot of ideas and I talk about my ideas with the people I talk
    to. People who talk about ideas say things that are wrong or that they don''t
    agree with sometimes. People who don''t say wrong things sometimes are groomed
    by focus groups and handlers and lawyers. That''s not me. I have great ideas.
    People who only say perfect words don''t have ideas. They don''t make great ideas.

  pPost: 'I think Trump is trolling the media. He disavows David Duke. Then he says
    he doesn''t know David Duke. Then he tweets that he had previously disavowed him
    Then he says his earpiece was broken. Seriously does David Duke matter? If Trump
    said something mean to Megyn Kelly or John McCain does that matter? None of this
    matters. Trump is just trolling them for attention. I think he''s just making
    a parody of all of these little half baked character examinations that the media
    does over the course of the campaign. They take it very seriously and Trump is
    just showing what a joke this whole thing is. They''re giving him tons of free
    air time and he''s winning. Now I don''t think this situation is ideal but he
    had no other choice given the media''s blackout on inconvenient facts about race.
    If you remember the Richwine affair, the media pilloried Richwine but they never
    let him on any of the news networks to present any of his empirical evidence.
    NBC even had an article accusing him of &quot;immigrant scapegoating&quot;. If
    you remember the Bell Curve and how severe the media misrepresentations of that
    were. Ann Coulter''s Adios America was apparently a best seller but the media
    wouldn''t review it. They won''t present the evidence or arguments accurately
    and instead they spin the whole thing as a personal insult against group X and
    the person hardly ever gets to go on to respond. So if Trump had presented a bunch
    of studies and papers and made a good wonkish argument against mass third world
    immigration. The media would have just shut him out of the conversation. They
    just don''t give a platform to anyone like that. They might talk about how he
    insulted Latinos before they start ignoring him completely and that''s what would
    happen. But he got a platform by trolling them. They thought he would be a useful
    tool to point to as a dumb racist and that was his way in. It''s the only way
    he could win with the medias blackout on inconvenient facts about race. And now
    they will lose ratings if they ignore him, checkmate. It''s worked brilliantly,
    Trump is the maestro of memetic warfare. '

    &#8216;I&#8217;m Trump All The Way,&#8217; Says Man Who Will Die From Mishandling
    Fireworks Months Before Election YOUNGSTOWN, OH&#8212;According to statements
    made Monday by local resident David Kearney, a 36-year-old delivery driver who
    will die in a fireworks mishap months before the general election, he is &#8220;a
    Trump man all the way.&#8221; &#8220;I like what Trump has to say&#8212;he isn&#8217;t
    afraid to take on anyone,&#8221; said the man who, long before November, will
    be pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital after duct-taping several M-80s
    together in his backyard, lighting the self-rigged explosive device, and then,
    after accidentally knocking the mortar tube on its side while attempting to run
    away from the blast, will suffer severe trauma as his &#8220;Stone Cold&#8221;
    Steve Austin shirt and cargo shorts are set ablaze while his horrified family
    looks on. &#8220;The politicians in Washington lie to our faces. Trump&#8217;s
    the only one who tells the truth. He&#8217;ll turn the country around.&#8221;
    Kearney said he was convinced to vote for Trump by the candidate&#8217;s debate
    performances, events he was narrowly able to witness following a close call last
    summer when his ATV overturned at high speed after he lost control of the vehicle
    while firing a handgun at a stop sign. "

  pPost: 'A walk down memory lane with one of the most virulent anti-immigrant senators
    who just endorsed Donald Trump: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/sess...ing-called-boy
    Quote: When it became clear that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) was poised to become
    ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, we recalled this 2002 article
    by Sarah Wildman which addresses some of the controversies that kept Sessions
    from being confirmed in 1986 as a U.S. District Court judge in Alabama. Wildman
    writes in particular that the testimonies of two witnesses--a Justice Department
    employee named J. Gerald Hebert, and a black Sessions subordinate named Thomas
    Figures--helped to doom Sessions, then a U.S. Attorney, at his Judiciary Committee
    confirmation hearings. According to Wildman, Hebert testified reluctantly &quot;that
    in a conversation between the two men Sessions had labeled the National Association
    for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties
    Union (ACLU) &quot;un-American&quot; and &quot;Communist-inspired.&quot; And Figures--then
    an assistant U.S. Attorney--told the committee that &quot;during a 1981 murder
    investigation involving the Ku Klux Klan, Sessions was heard by several colleagues
    commenting that he ''used to think they [the Klan] were OK'' until he found out
    some of them were ''pot smokers.''&quot; Today we obtained a copy of the transcript
    of the Sessions hearings--over 500-pages worth--and it turns out there''s quite
    a bit more. We''re still going through it, of course, but the Figures testimony
    alone contains some damning details. Figures recalled one occasion in which the
    Justice Department''s Civil Rights Division sent them instructions to investigate
    a case that Sessions had tried to close: &quot;We had a very spirited discussion
    regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument,
    Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, ''I wish I could decline
    on all of them.''&quot; All of them, according to Figures, meant civil rights
    cases generally. As he explained at one point: &quot;[T]he statement, the manner
    in which it was delivered, the impression on his face, the manner in which his
    face blushed, I believe it represented a hostility to investigating and pursuing
    those types of matters.&quot; Figures said that Sessions had called him &quot;boy&quot;
    on a number of occasions, and had cautioned him to be careful what he said to
    &quot;white folks. &quot;Mr. Sessions admonished me to ''be careful what you say
    to white folks,''&quot; Figures testified. &quot;Had Mr. Sessions merely urged
    me to be careful what I said to ''folks,'' that admonition would have been quite
    reasonable. But that was not the language that he used.&quot; In response to these
    allegations, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) asked him if he''d ever objected to this
    behavior. Senator &quot;Did you ever say anything to them? Did you ever say, knock
    it off, or quit it?&quot; Figures admitted he hadn''t: &quot;Senator, I felt that
    if I had said anything or reacted in a manner in which I thought appropriate,
    I would be fired. I always felt that my position was very tentative around Mr.
    Sessions.&quot; At one point during his testimony, Figures paid Sessions a backhanded
    compliment on his overall professionalism. &quot;In all fairness to Mr. Sessions,
    however, I should make clear that the problems which existed in the area of civil
    rights were not present in other aspects of my case assignments,&quot; said Figures.
    &quot;Except in criminal civil rights cases, Mr. Sessions deferred to my recommendations
    regarding whether to pursue cases, and never withdrew a case assignment because
    he disagreed with my recommendation.&quot; Thomas Figures still practices law
    in Mobile, Alabama, but could not be reached by phone this afternoon. We''ll keep
    perusing the testimony and report any other noteworthy details. '

    to hide his opinions on the billionaire Republican. Jerry Slankard of Strasburg
    used manure from his fifteen cows and bulls to write the words &quot;No Trump&quot;

  pPost: 'One of a number of debunkings of that awful &quot;study&quot; http://keithhennessey.com/2013/05/09...tudy-problems/
    Quote: Eight problems with the Heritage immigration cost estimate On Monday the
    Heritage Foundation released a paper, The Fiscal Cost of Unlawful Immigrants and
    Amnesty to the U.S. Taxpayer. Along with Heritage******post can''t decode******s
    new director Jim DeMint, the study******post can''t decode******s senior author,
    Robert Rector, also published a Washington Post op-ed titled, ******post can''t
    decode******What amnesty for illegal immigrants will cost America.******post can''t
    decode****** The key substantive point of the paper and op-ed is a $6.3 trillion
    number: An exhaustive study by the Heritage Foundation has found that after amnesty,
    current unlawful immigrants would receive $9.4 trillion in government benefits
    and services and pay more than $3 trillion in taxes over their lifetimes. That
    leaves a net fiscal deficit (benefits minus taxes) of $6.3 trillion. I expect
    making 8-9 million people here illegally into U.S. citizens would increase future
    deficits once these people are eligible for benefits. But there are so many problems
    with the Heritage study that this $6.3 trillion number is useless for making policy
    decisions. It might as well be plucked out of thin air. Others have criticized
    the Heritage study, including a detailed critique from Cato******post can''t decode******s
    Alex Nowrasteh. I******post can''t decode******m adding to that here. The basics
    of estimating government expenditures for an entitlement program are simple. Figure
    out the number of people who will receive subsidies; Figure out how much the government
    will spend, on average, per person per year; Choose your timeframe, measured in
    years; Multiply (1) by (2) by (3) and you******post can''t decode******re done.
    The Heritage study makes errors in each step. 1. The study purports to measure
    the ******post can''t decode******cost ******post can''t decode****** of amnesty.******post
    can''t decode****** Let******post can''t decode******s set aside whether amnesty
    is the appropriate word to describe what is in the Gang of Eight******post can''t
    decode******s bill. The fiscal cost of ******post can''t decode******amnesty******post
    can''t decode****** is the incremental cost of making those here illegally eligible
    for government payments and services relative to what we have now. People here
    illegally are already imposing fiscal costs by driving on the highways, using
    public parks, relying on local firefighters for emergency services, and in some
    cases receiving uncompensated care in emergency rooms. Some children here illegally
    are already receiving free public education. Making those children U.S. citizens
    doesn******post can''t decode******t increase the cost to the state of educating
    them. There are significant incremental costs to amnesty, mostly from millions
    of people eventually becoming eligible for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
    food stamps, and cash assistance. But in addition to these incremental costs,
    Heritage incorporates all of the baseline costs in their $6.3 trillion estimate
    of ******post can''t decode******amnesty.******post can''t decode****** By measuring
    total rather than marginal costs, they are telling us the cost of making millions
    of people legal relative to the cost of somehow finding and deporting all of them.
    Setting aside my view that such an alternative is infeasible, it is inaccurate
    to describe such an estimate as the cost of amnesty. It is instead the cost of
    amnesty relative to some other state of the world that Heritage would prefer.
    That is both misleading and not particularly useful to policymakers. The study
    authors acknowledge this. On page 29 of they write: The $6.3 trillion figure represents
    the lifetime fiscal costs of unlawful immigrant households after amnesty. It does
    not represent the increased fiscal costs caused by amnesty alone. The increased
    lifetime costs caused by amnesty would equal $6.3 trillion minus the estimated
    lifetime fiscal costs of unlawful immigrant households under current law. The
    killer problem comes with the way Heritage is marketing the study. $6.3 trillion
    is Heritage******post can''t decode******s estimate of the total costs of illegal
    immigrants if ******post can''t decode******amnesty******post can''t decode******
    is granted. But the op-ed is titled ******post can''t decode******What amnesty
    for illegal immigrants will cost America,******post can''t decode****** and the
    op-ed says ******post can''t decode******amnesty has a substantial price tag,******post
    can''t decode****** thus mistakenly presenting $6.3 trillion as the marginal cost
    of a proposed policy change. The study says one not very useful thing, while the
    op-ed markets the study******post can''t decode******s results as something else
    entirely. 2. In addition to not being an estimate of the cost of ******post can''t
    decode******amnesty,******post can''t decode****** the $6.3 trillion number does
    not measure the cost of illegal immigrants, either. The study includes a number
    calculated from looking at 12.7 million people, then labels that the cost of ******post
    can''t decode******illegal immigrants.******post can''t decode****** Contained
    within those 12.7 million people are 4.5 million children born in the U.S. to
    at least one parent here illegally. These children are U.S. citizens. Heritage
    is inflating the population of ******post can''t decode******illegal immigrants******post
    can''t decode****** measured by 55% = (4.5 / (12.7 ******post can''t decode******
    4.5)). The Heritage logic is that those 4.5 million children are in the U.S. only
    as a result of illegal immigration, so the costs of providing them with taxpayer
    services are costs of illegal immigration. Heritage is correct that, had those
    8.2 million adults here illegally never arrived, those 4.5 million children would
    not have been born in the U.S. But you can******post can''t decode******t unring
    the bell. Whatever your view on whether policy failed by granting citizenship
    to the U.S.-born children of an illegal immigrant, these children are now U.S.
    citizens and entitled to benefits (and with the requirement to eventually pay
    taxes). The fiscal costs of these citizen children can******post can''t decode******t
    be counted as the cost of ******post can''t decode******amnesty for illegal immigrants,******post
    can''t decode****** since (a) they are being paid now and (b) they will continue
    to be paid even if their parents do not get benefits. At best Heritage******post
    can''t decode******s estimate is not the cost of ******post can''t decode******amnesty******post
    can''t decode****** for illegal immigrants. It is an estimate of the cost of ******post
    can''t decode******amnesty******post can''t decode****** for 8.7 million illegal
    immigrants plus the costs of benefits for 4.5 million U.S. citizen children. While
    the study acknowledges that their estimate depends heavily on this unusual redefinition,
    the op-ed and Heritage******post can''t decode******s subsequent promotional efforts
    do not. In the study the authors carefully acknowledge: For example, any study
    that excludes the welfare benefits and educational services received by the minor
    U.S.-born children of unlawful immigrant parents from the costs assigned to unlawful
    immigrant households will reach very different conclusions about the fiscal consequences
    of illegal immigration. The DeMint/Rector op-ed makes no such distinction and
    is factually incorrect because it includes the benefit spending for 4.5 million
    U.S. citizens (emphasis added by me): ******post can''t decode****** current unlawful
    immigrants would receive $9.4 trillion in government benefits******post can''t
    decode****** As we******post can''t decode******ll see next, the study is also
    not really a complaint about the fiscal effects of illegal immigrants, or even
    of immigrants generally. It is instead a complaint about low income people receiving
    net government subsidies. 3. The logic behind the study can be summed up like
    this: Poor U.S. citizens cost the government money because they receive more in
    benefits than they pay in taxes; Immigrants tend, on average, to be fairly low
    on the income scale; Illegal immigrants even more so; therefore Making illegal
    immigrants legal (at some point) will therefore increase future deficits. But
    other than the ******post can''t decode******even more so******post can''t decode******
    point, this isn******post can''t decode******t really an argument about illegal
    immigrants. It******post can''t decode******s an argument about the existence
    of low-income Americans, a redistributive safety net and old-age subsidies, and
    an income tax system that exempts about 45% of Americans from paying income taxes.
    Senator DeMint and Dr. Rector write: Yet immigrants should come to our nation
    lawfully and should not impose additional fiscal costs on our overburdened taxpayers.
    I agree with the first part, but they run into trouble on the second. If you believe
    their numbers, legal immigrants also impose additional fiscal costs on our overburdened
    taxpayers. The Heritage logic would apply equally to legal immigrants and to babies
    born to low income U.S. citizens. I know Heritage is not opposed to either of
    those, but the logic of this study (and the language in the op-ed) would seem
    to lead to such a conclusion. 4. Even more generally, the study is actually a
    critique of our unbalanced federal budget for everyone, and not just for the poor,
    much less for a subset of the poor. The federal budget is terribly out of whack,
    the result of promising way too many entitlement spending benefits without raising
    the taxes needed to pay them. (I would of course solve this by changing the spending
    promises, not by raising taxes.) Entitlement spending promises to seniors are
    the largest cause of this problem and are the drivers of unsustainable federal
    and state government spending trends. Illegal immigrants are being promised far
    more in benefits than they will pay in taxes not just because they are on average
    low income, but because almost everyone is being promised old age benefits that
    will exceed the taxes they will pay. In addition, Heritage******post can''t decode******s
    calculations mistakenly assume that Social Security and Medicare benefits will
    be paid in full to newly legal immigrants for the next 50 years, even though (a)
    it******post can''t decode******s obvious that neither program******post can''t
    decode******s spending is sustainable in its current form for even half that time;
    and (b) current law includes a mandated 27% cut in Social Security benefits once
    the Social Security ******post can''t decode******trust fund******post can''t
    decode****** has a zero balance, and a 13% cut in Medicare part A benefits when
    the Hospital Insurance ******post can''t decode******trust fund******post can''t
    decode****** hits the wall. As a result, Heritage******post can''t decode******s
    estimates of the direct old-age benefit costs for newly legal immigrants are too
    high. 5. The authors do a lot of work to group illegal immigrants by educational
    level (as a proxy for income) and to estimate the fiscal costs for various eligibility
    phase-in timeframes. But, as best I can tell, they assume that a poor, low-skilled,
    poorly educated illegal immigrant will remain poor, low-skill, and poorly educated,
    and that he will draw government subsidies his entire life. Incomes typically
    climb as a worker ages (including for low-skilled, low-wage workers). Some people
    who arrive in the U.S. illegally may initially take jobs well below their skill
    level because of language barriers that they later overcome. Others will get further
    education or build skills over time. Since government subsidies relate inversely
    to income, if you assume illegal immigrants will never see their education, skills,
    or income increase, then you******post can''t decode******ll overestimate the
    government subsidies spent on their behalf and underestimate the taxes they pay.
    Ignoring the potential for self-improvement and economic advancement inflates
    the cost estimate. Let******post can''t decode******s not forget that those here
    illegally are the subset of those back home who had some combination of skills,
    determination, and savvy to make it to the U.S. despite significant barriers.
    6. More broadly, the fear of discovery and deportation has to constrain the labor
    supplied by those here illegally. A talented electrical engineer here illegally
    might now be working in an unskilled job because green card verification is weaker
    for driving a cab than for working at Cisco or Intel. A spouse here illegally
    might choose to stay at home with the kids rather than seek paid work because
    the former has significantly lower risk of being discovered by immigration authorities.
    Eliminating these deportation risks will increase the available labor supply.
    Increased labor supply means a larger GDP, a larger tax base, and higher government
    revenues. Heritage appears to ignore all these supply-side labor effects, which
    is unusual from an organization that in other contexts has championed consideration
    of supply-side effects in fiscal estimates. 7. To get their huge numbers Heritage
    sums up spending over a 50-year period. They adjust their estimates of future
    spending and taxes for inflation but not for the time value of money. Most official
    legislative cost estimates are done for a 5 or 10-year period, in which these
    effects are small and customarily ignored. But nobody adds up a 50-year fiscal
    stream without either discounting it or measuring it as a % of GDP rather than
    in real $. Using a 3% real long-term interest rate (CBO******post can''t decode******s
    assumption), a dollar of cost 50 years from now is equivalent to a 23¢ cost today.
    Heritage counts this cost as a dollar rather than 23 cents. They should be showing
    us net present values if they want to do long-term estimates. It******post can''t
    decode******s tough to say exactly, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests
    this almost doubles their final number. 8. Finally, the DeMint/Rector op-ed purports
    to describe what illegal immigrants ******post can''t decode******will cost America,******post
    can''t decode****** when in fact they are looking only at what they will cost
    American governments. This is an important oversimplification and a surprising
    one from an institution as reliably conservative as Heritage, which I would never
    expect to make the mistake of equating the Government with the Nation. I happen
    to think the cultural and non-governmental economic benefits of a robust immigration
    system and a resolution of the problem of a stock of 8-9 million people here illegally
    far outweigh the likely impact on the federal budget, but you might make a different
    judgment call. Either way, it******post can''t decode******s obvious that the
    federal budget is only part of the calculus, and the op-ed erred in suggesting
    otherwise. To summarize, the $6.3 trillion number offered by Heritage as ******post
    can''t decode******the cost of unlawful immigrants and amnesty******post can''t
    decode******: Does not estimate the marginal cost of an amnesty program or whatever
    is in the Gang of Eight bill relative to anything other than a fantasy state of
    the world; Includes costs for 4.5 million U.S. citizen children in its estimate
    of the costs of illegal immigrants; Employs logic extensible to both legal immigrants
    and poor U.S. citizens, and thus is actually a critique of government tax-and-spending
    redistribution more than of illegal immigration; Mistakenly assumes that unsustainable
    Social Security and Medicare benefits will be paid to newly-legal immigrants for
    50 years when both programs will go bankrupt long before; Ignores supply-side
    labor effects by mistakenly assuming that an illegal immigrant who is poor and
    receiving government benefits will remain poor for 50 years, that he will not
    learn new skills or increase his income, and that he will not find a better-paying
    job or take additional work after eliminating the risk of deportation; Ignores
    the time value of money; and Mistakenly labels the cost to the Government as the
    cost to the Nation, ignoring the cultural and non-fiscal economic benefits and
    costs of changing immigration policy. There is a significant fiscal effect from
    making 8-9 million people into U.S. citizens and making them legal taxpayers and
    eventually beneficiaries eligible for the full panoply of government subsidies.
    But Heritage******post can''t decode******s $6.3 trillion figure is not a good
    estimate of that effect and is useless for making policy decisions. I am a fan
    of Heritage and respect many of their scholars and their policy work. Unfortunately
    this study and op-ed are not up to their usual standard. They subtract value from
    an informed policy debate about an important topic. '

    Robert Rector and Jason Richwine unveiled a Heritage Foundation study on the cost
    to taxpayers associated with &quot;amnesty.&quot; Heritage is now shopping the
    study''s $6.3 trillion figure as the cost of the Senate immigration reform bill,
    though the study''s authors admit that the study''s findings have nothing to do
    with the bill in question. Regardless, many policymakers have repeated the study''s
    findings. A number of conservative economists and policy scholars have taken a
    deeper look at the Heritage study, however, and found it to be completely unsound
    and unreliable. A summary of conservative criticisms is below. The authors employ
    static scoring rather than dynamic scoring. This is the same error liberals make
    when they evaluate tax cuts: It ignores indirect fiscal effects that result from
    changes in economic growth. There is almost no consideration of wage increases
    that result from legalization, or the impact of an increasingly flexible labor
    market on economic growth. The authors write that unlawful immigrant households
    generate annual earnings of $38,988. Tim Kane notes that &quot;unless they expect
    readers to believe all this household income (a) generates no productive work
    and (b) is 100 percent remitted abroad, consuming nothing in the U.S. macro economy,
    then the report is misleading. Sources: Alex Nowrasteh, &quot;Heritage''s Flawed

    http://keithhennessey.com/2013/05/09...tudy-problems/ Two-thirds of the purported

    cost that will exist regardless of &quot;amnesty&quot;. Roughly 40 percent of
    the spending Heritage projects will go toward U.S. citizens in the form of means-tested
    benefits and education spending for American children born to immigrants. This
    accounts for nearly two-thirds of the fiscal deficit generated by &quot;amnesty,&quot;
    and it is already baked into the cake. The only way to eliminate this cost is
    to deport children who are U.S. citizens along with their undocumented parents.

    The authors calculate the total cost instead of the increased marginal cost of
    &#8220;amnesty&#8221;. The $6.3 trillion figure includes costs already associated
    with undocumented immigrants, regardless of their legal status. In the study,
    the authors concede that &#8220;The $6.3 trillion figure represents the lifetime
    fiscal costs of unlawful immigrant households after amnesty. It does not represent
    the increased fiscal costs of amnesty alone.&#8221; In other words, many of the
    costs cited in this report are already borne by taxpayers, such as unlawful immigrants&#8217;
    use of highways, public parks, and public education. To include these costs in
    the overall calculation is misleading. Source: Keith Hennessey, &quot;Eight problems

    The authors assume immigrants will maintain low skill, income, and education levels
    for life. Because their work assumes that immigrants are incapable of improving
    their lots in life, the costs associated with an individual immigrant do not decrease
    over time, nor do taxes paid increase. Source: Keith Hennessey, &quot;Eight problems

    The study ignores the fact that undocumented status hampers productivity. &quot;Fear
    of discovery and deportation&quot; likely prevents some undocumented immigrants
    from unleashing their full productive capacity, keeping their wages low and artificially
    constraining the labor supply. Upon legalization it should be assumed that some
    undocumented immigrants will move to better-paying jobs, and that some spouses
    currently living at home will find legal paid employment. Both would increase
    GDP and tax collections. Source: Keith Hennessey, &quot;Eight problems with the
    Heritage immigration cost estimate&quot;. http://keithhennessey.com/2013/05/09...tudy-problems/
    The authors exaggerate immigrant welfare use. A study by the Cato Institute found
    that low-income immigrants are less likely to use welfare than low-income native-born
    Americans. And when they do accept public benefits the dollar value in benefits
    they receive is less than low-income native-born Americans. Source: Alex Nowrasteh,
    &quot;Heritage''s Flawed Immigration Analysis.&quot; http://www.cato.org/blog/heritages-f...ation-analysis
    The alternative comparison is absurd. The authors compare &quot;amnesty&quot;
    with an alternative in which all undocumented immigrants self-deport at age 55.
    They assume a baseline cost of $1 trillion under this scenario, making the &#8220;net
    cost of amnesty&#8221; $5.3 trillion. This is completely unrealistic. Tim Kane,
    &quot;Immigration Errors.&quot; http://balanceofeconomics.com/2013/0...ration-errors/
    Heritage ignores the economic cost of deporting all undocumented immigrants. The
    authors of the Heritage study are implicitly pushing for removal of all immigrants
    here illegally. A study by the Cato Institute, using dynamic analysis, found that
    the removal of all undocumented immigrants would yield a $2.6 trillion decrease
    in GDP growth over 10 years. Source: Alex Nowrasteh, &quot;Heritage''s Flawed
    Immigration Analysis.&quot; http://www.cato.org/blog/heritages-f...ation-analysis
    Heritage ignores the fiscal cost of deporting all undocumented immigrants. The
    government spends $18,000 per immigrant apprehension. When factoring in detention
    and deportation, the overall cost of an enforcement-only approach would be hundreds
    of billions of dollars. Source: Alex Nowrasteh, &quot;Heritage''s Flawed Immigration
    Analysis.&quot; http://www.cato.org/blog/heritages-f...ation-analysis This is
    not a compelling argument about illegal immigration; it is an argument against
    income redistribution and the welfare state. The authors draw the conclusion that
    illegal immigration is bad because of the fiscal costs it imposes on taxpayers
    via public benefits like education, health care, and direct welfare payments.
    But these costs apply to low-income Americans as well. The United States has a
    welfare problem, not an immigration problem. According to Diana Furchtgott-Roth,
    &#8220;If we''re concerned that benefits are keeping people in poverty and impeding
    upward mobility, we should cut benefits, not immigrants.&#8221; Sources: Keith

    Heritage does not use the net present value to discount long-term costs. Over
    a 50 year period, costs should be discounted to today''s value in order to present
    an honest accounting of the long-term liability. Keith Hennessy suggests that

    Cost of Unlawful Immigrants and Amnesty to the U.S. Taxpayer So the critiques
    you posted are straw manning them by pointing to the part of the paper where they
    calculate the cost of unlawful immigrants and then claiming that they presented
    this as the cost of amnesty. you can see the part where they just talk about amnesty
    is much more modest. But that''s why you don''t interpret &quot;the costs of unlawful
    immigrants and amnesty&quot; as &quot;the costs of amnesty&quot;. '

    Trump is hilarious, you guys. The Republican presidential candidate literally

    will be huge and Mexico will pay for it and America will be great again. His sexism
    is nauseating, his ignorance cringe-worthy, his conduct baffling. He provides
    more memes, gifs, jokes and video games than one could possibly have time for.
    And he really is winning. In advance of the South Carolina primary on Sunday,
    a joke circulated online asking women if they******post can''t decode******d have
    sex with Trump, if it meant he******post can''t decode******d drop out of the
    race. My answer would be ******post can''t decode******no******post can''t decode******
    for at least three reasons: I am not an American citizen, and this is not the
    kind of thing one should even remotely consider doing for a foreign country. Even
    if Trump dropped out of the race, what would we do about the people who support
    his brand of hatred? Would they give up their claims to US citizenship, too? I******post
    can''t decode******ve heard this question before. Well, not exactly this question.
    As an Italian citizen, I have heard different variations on this question******post

    the Donald. It******post can''t decode******s been said before that Trump is America******post
    can''t decode******s Berlusconi, and the comparison is easy to see. Both are older
    white men with a lot of wealth of dubious provenance. Both decided to enter the
    public arena after promising they would run their countries the way they run their
    companies. Both are openly misogynistic while claiming to love women, and both
    share a questionable sense of humor. They appeal to what in Italy is referred
    to as ******post can''t decode******the belly******post can''t decode****** of
    the electorate******post can''t decode******their gut reactions to the issues
    at hand. Both Trump and Berlusconi represent populism at its worst. And their
    tactics work. Both men are populism at its worst. And their tactics work. But
    perhaps the most striking similarity I can draw between Trump and Berlusconi has
    nothing to do with their actions. No, the thing that is most worrisome about the
    uncanny resemblance between these two politicians is the dangerous way the public
    and media have perceived their candidacies. Donald******post can''t decode******s
    showmanship is unmatched. From headlines to videos to petitions to stop him (including
    by his adversaries), Trump is the dominant story in politics these days. I made
    a similar argument before when Narendra Modi was running for prime minister in
    India. It******post can''t decode******s like that trick kids play on one another:
    Say ******post can''t decode******milk******post can''t decode****** twenty times

    think ******post can''t decode******white.******post can''t decode****** Talk
    about Trump everywhere, all the time, and suddenly he******post can''t decode******s
    the only thing people will be paying attention to. Just check out this telling
    map, which shows the top-searched Republican candidate by county, shared by Google
    Trends ahead of Feb. 25 Republican debate: Awash in red.(Quartz via Google) There
    is an old marketing adage that says it doesn******post can''t decode******t matter
    what they say about your brand (or you) so long that they******post can''t decode******re
    talking about it. The second-most asked question about Trump, according to a recent
    Google Trends search, was ******post can''t decode******Is there any stopping
    Donald Trump?******post can''t decode****** But clearly, thinking about stopping
    Trump is not, in fact, doing much to stop him. When Berlusconi had his last comeback,
    during the 2013 elections, he was brought back as a scarecrow by his opponents.
    They allowed him to shape their campaign, making their platform one based on being
    against him rather than in favor of something. This is a mistake that unfailingly
    favors the adversary, with catastrophic results. But there******post can''t decode******s
    an even more troubling parallel between Berlusconi and Trump: People love to laugh
    at them. Trump is very easy to laugh at******post can''t decode******and I do
    mean at, rather than with. Berlusconi was too, with his terrible jokes, terrible
    Italian, and terrible hair. What he said wasn******post can''t decode******t taken
    seriously, and he willingly played the buffoon role, all the way to the Palazzo
    Chigi. Remember when he called Barack Obama ******post can''t decode******tanned******post
    can''t decode****** (twice)? When he posed making a horn sign with his hands in
    a European Union leaders meeting? I remember every single one of these incidents******post
    can''t decode******so hilarious to the foreign press. Trust me: it******post can''t
    decode******s a lot less funny from the inside. Like Trump, Berlusconi consistently
    seemed too absurd to be true. And yet he was. He won elections again, and again,
    and again, thriving off any and all attention. People didn******post can''t decode******t
    take him or what he said seriously. Then one day we woke up to find our government
    overrun by criminals, our economy destroyed, and our cultural mores perverted
    to the extent that the objectification of women was commonplace. There was no
    more laughing left to do. Don******post can''t decode******t let Trump troll his
    way to the presidential candidacy. He may not even be the worst candidate on the
    Republican side******post can''t decode******as far as I can tell, that******post
    can''t decode******s a very, very close race******post can''t decode******but
    in any case he needs to be taken seriously. What he says is worrisome and has
    enabled and indeed normalized some of the darkest and most racist beliefs of his
    base. (Nearly 20% of his supporters in South Carolina believe slavery shouldn******post
    can''t decode******t have been abolished.) The time for voyeurism and condescension
    and exclamations of ******post can''t decode******You won******post can''t decode******t
    believe what he said!******post can''t decode****** has long passed. Because I

    Trump would get the Republican nomination for quite a while now. But unlike what
    happened in my country, I believe Americans won******post can''t decode******t
    make him their next president. That said, a word of warning to Americans and the
    American media: Enough with the humor and the sarcasm, what you need now is straightforward,
    fact-based, political confrontation. On the brink of ******post can''t decode******Super
    Tuesday,******post can''t decode****** your country risks becoming the butt of

    The only argument you can truly make is that some immigrants take jobs that native
    low-skilled folks simply do not want to do. Unfortunately, they also take jobs
    that the natives do want to do for a lower wage, which then also has knock on
    impacts on the average wage for low-skilled native workers. In addition to costing
    us a ton of money, contrary to what others have suggested it does appear to lower
    wages: http://cis.org/Richwine-wages-Mariel Quote: The Card study is ubiquitous
    in immigration advocacy, garnering citations in seemingly every case for loosening
    the borders. It is &quot;the single greatest bit of evidence&quot; that immigration
    does not harm native wages, according to Adam Davidson in a recent piece for the
    New York Times Magazine.2 Davidson argues that, based on the Mariel experience,
    the United States can take in 11 million immigrants per year without negative
    effects. And why stop at 11 million? In making a recent argument for open borders,
    Vox''s Dylan Matthews cited the boatlift as his first piece of evidence that immigration
    has a &quot;neutral or positive&quot; effect on native workers.3 The policy stakes
    are high, which is probably why a new paper questioning Card''s classic study
    has generated so much attention. Harvard economist George Borjas4 reanalyzed the
    effects of the boatlift in September of last year, this time looking specifically
    at how the influx of low-skill workers affected native high school dropouts in
    Miami.5 He found a large drop in their wages after the boatlift, bottoming out
    in the mid-1980s at almost 40 percent below the wage trend in control cities.
    Also this idea that wages can continuously rise over time an no industries/jobs
    will have to shrink/disappear is a fantasy. '

    is a better story than &quot;the top 2% is 17% richer this year while the bottom

    Trump''s strongest demo is independents, and he has the highest crossover numbers
    of any Republican. No one comes even close. Gill mentioned this earlier, working

    promising jobbies while Clinton is talking about trans bathroom issues and rethink

    Quote: In a provocative paper, Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) provide evidence that

    in happiness. The current paper draws upon novel data from the DDB Needham Life
    Style Survey to take another look at the evolution of women******post can''t decode******s
    subjective well-being. In contrast to Stevenson and Wolfers, I find that men and
    women between 1985 and 2005 experienced similar decreases in life satisfaction.
    Furthermore, both sexes witnessed comparable slippages in self-confi- dence, growing
    regrets about the past, and declines in virtually every measure of selfreported
    physical and mental health. The data also show that men******post can''t decode******s
    well-being in recent years has begun to fall more rapidly than that for women.
    In the final section of the paper, I present some initial evidence that the steady
    erosion in social and civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and financial security
    could be partially responsible for the widespread decline in subjective well-being
    over the past few decades Sounds like a social capital problem. Robert Putnam''s
    research has shown that racial diversity negatively impacts social capital. Yes
    we are less well off than we were and our current immigration policy is making
    it worse. '

    Quote: In a provocative paper, Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) provide evidence that
    women over the last several decades experienced an absolute and relative decline
    in happiness. The current paper draws upon novel data from the DDB Needham Life
    Style Survey to take another look at the evolution of women******post can''t decode******s
    subjective well-being. In contrast to Stevenson and Wolfers, I find that men and
    women between 1985 and 2005 experienced similar decreases in life satisfaction.
    Furthermore, both sexes witnessed comparable slippages in self-confi- dence, growing
    regrets about the past, and declines in virtually every measure of selfreported
    physical and mental health. The data also show that men******post can''t decode******s
    well-being in recent years has begun to fall more rapidly than that for women.
    In the final section of the paper, I present some initial evidence that the steady
    erosion in social and civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and financial security
    could be partially responsible for the widespread decline in subjective well-being
    over the past few decades '

    without college degrees, and live in regions with racial resentment. Trump doesn''t
    have wide appeal and there is no actual evidence he has crossover appeal to Democrats

    I''m putting forward a theory about why it is more rational for blue collar workers
    to support Trump than any other candidate. This is not the same as me telling
    blue collar workers they shouldn''t support Trump. It is the opposite of that.

    really this dumb? Read the post of mine that he was responding to. Not edgy dorks,
    frustrated people from all walks of life who are being confidently promised action
    by Trump in a way very different from other politicians who are promising the
    exact same things in the exact same way that they have been for decades with no

    that they hate the Republican party. There are some good reasons to hate the Republican
    party that go beyond the liberal-conservative dichotomy. The Republican party
    has done nothing for anyone for a long time. Ask yourself what the Democrats have
    done for people and you can get an idea of what we''re up for in the general election. '

    for comedy because by definition it is not to be taken serious, but people aren''t
    perfect and the brain is a messed up place. Even if meant to be taken in jest
    jokes can hurt people, and you don''t get to decide whether or not your hurt someone,
    just whether or not you care. It''s not that I think you shouldn''t have free
    speech, I just think speech with the intent to harm or speech with no regard for
    the harm it can do is very dangerous. If you think calling my weewee an RPG is
    harmful and dangerous speech I would suggest logging off of the internet '

    a group of people whose most extreme opinions are often held in check. There is
    nothing about Hillary''s message or her perceived message by the Shaquitas that
    would legitimize any sort of suppressed terrible viewpoint to come out. Shaquita
    likely supports her because her husband did lots of good stuff for the black community/she''s
    the Democratic establishment candidate/her friends are all doing it. If part of
    Hillary''s message was that she too-quickly re-tweeted how great the Black Panthers
    were and how they should be given government support, then I''d agree you can
    draw this comparison. I am surprised so many people seem unable to grok this very

    scenario, with enough electorate frustration, plus really good demagoguery and
    speeches where, just for example, he calls Paul Ryan a loser at the SOTU (I would
    lol), one can envision president trump getting a lot done. Would it be &quot;good&quot;?

    grocery store sticker price. In 2006, farmers received an average of 30 percent
    of the retail price of fresh fruits and 25 percent of the retail price of fresh
    vegetables, so consumer expenditures on fresh produce meant $118 to the farmer.
    Farm labor costs are typically less than a third of farm revenue for fresh fruits
    and vegetables, meaning that farm worker wages and benefits for fresh fruits and
    vegetables cost the average household $38 a year. Consumers who pay $1 for a pound
    of apples are giving 30 cents to the farmer and 10 cents to the farm worker; those
    spending $2 for a head of lettuce are giving 50 cents to the farmer and 16 cents
    to the farm worker. If the influx of immigrant workers were slowed or stopped
    and farm wages rose, what would happen to expenditures on fresh fruits and vegetables?
    A case study from 1966 could give us some idea. That year, the United Farm Workers
    union won a 40 percent wage increase for some table grape harvesters, largely
    because the end of the Bracero program had cut off a supply of Mexican workers.
    The average earnings of U.S. field workers were $10.07 an hour in 2009, according
    to a U.S.D.A. survey of farm employers. If pressure to verify employees******post
    can''t decode****** legal status resulted in a labor crisis similar to the one
    in 1966 and a similar 40 percent wage increase, average hourly earnings would
    rise to $14.10. If this were passed on to consumers, the 10 cent farm labor cost
    of a pound of apples would rise to 14 cents, and the $1 retail price would rise
    to $1.04. For a typical household, a 40 percent increase in farm labor costs translates
    into a 3.6 percent increase in retail prices. If farm wages rose 40 percent, and
    this wage increase were passed on to consumers, average spending on fresh fruits
    and vegetables would rise about $15 a year, the cost of two movie tickets. However,
    for a typical seasonal farm worker, a 40 percent wage increase could raise earnings
    from $10,000 for 1,000 hours of work to $14,000 ******post can''t decode******

    sand-kicking thing to do. OK, I hear you. You''ve explained your concerns...I
    appreciate it. seriously thanks. FYI my Facebook page is basically one endless

    100% of them are Trump supporters. I agree that this particular group which you''ve

    people know a racist when they see one. I''m sure many people would dispute any

    No bashing of heads, no making anything great, no walls, no mass deportation,

    back to America, none of it. Hilary sucks for sure, but America is doing just
    fine despite people like Hillary being in charge for so long. And it will continue
    to just fine, if not perfect, because we will never get anywhere even close to
    perfect. The downside of Trump is worse than the downside of anyone else running.

    the kind of forms a mortgage applicant might fill out, except with a cover page

    relatives, family income, number of dependents, whether they were particularly
    in need of money, as well as banking and contact information, including cell phone

    Quote: Throughout the experience, they wear you down with sleep deprivation, semi-starvation,
    and blaring music, including Sesame Street songs around the clock. They interrogate
    you constantly, employing enemy techniques copied from World War II, Korea, and
    Vietnam. (According to The New York Times, those techniques include fake-drowning
    or waterboarding) They say they don''t use excessive force, but it can be physically
    rough. No one likes to admit it, but bones and eardrums have been broken in the
    service of preparing American men and women for the reality of captivity. Hungry,
    exhausted and under relentless physical and psychological pressure, many trainees
    lose track of time and some begin to believe they''re experiencing the real thing.
    That''s the ultimate goal: to make you crack and fail in your mission and then
    show you how to put yourself back together again. The first phase is called hitting
    the wall--the moment when you believe you can''t take another step, when you can''t
    survive another minute, when you''re willing to do anything just to stop the misery.
    The course is carefully designed so that everyone hits the wall. In that critical
    moment, when you''re begging for food and rest, the trainers push you even harder.
    The purpose is to prove that you''re stronger than you know and that you can keep
    going. Success isn''t about your size or strength. Survival is all in your mind. '

    No we''ll get a Trump think tank and it will try to hire people like Jason Richwine,

    America isn''t really a thing, it is an abstract idea with some physical boundaries.
    Its people cannot be described in any aggregate way, and doing so impedes critical
    thinking. It is plainly false to say America is doing fine as it cannot have a

    shorthand for some statement such as &quot;the average American still has an abundance
    of opportunity so how about less bitching and more effort if you don''t like your
    life?&quot; regardless of how you meant it, there are some glaring issues which
    are harmful to most Americans: -Endless war. Remember when there was no war on
    terror and every friggin'' football and basketball game wasn''t a bullshit tribute
    to Sergeant OneLeg being reunited with his idiot kids? I sure do. I remember being
    in the ****in Army and it wasn''t really a big deal to anyone. Or clearing security
    with a soda and my shoes on. No, the TSA doesn''t ruin the country. But a few
    trillion bucks on endless pointless wars is not good. -Absurd higher ed costs.
    It''s government policy that does it. -Endlessly jailing people, especially black
    people. -Police state issues. Hi NSA. Those are all, as you might say, objectively
    bad. They are not fine and not good and all relatively recent, when people like
    Hillary were in charge. There was no war on terror in 1995. Mass incarceration
    of blacks was brought to you in large part by a Clinton. And the NSA stuff? 15-20
    years ago or so; it started before 9/11. College was a hell of a lot cheaper 20
    years ago too. I don''t blame Hillary. I blame people like her. They''ve been
    in charge. Wait, there is more. Other issues like wealth imbalances and inequality
    are a little hard to pin down. But they are real and they are due at least in
    part to a decision to bail out banks and endless low interest rate monetary policy
    impeding a clearing which would have made assets cheaper and allowed more people
    to participate in the post-crash rally. Now, long term asset appreciation is in
    doubt (because the 25 year downward trend in interest rates is over), higher education
    is unfathomably expensive, and asset prices, in the absence of much needed market
    clearing, are too high for many people to enter the market, especially those who
    borrowed money for college. Should these people suck it up and get to work? maybe.
    But their parents didn''t have to do any of that shit. Neither did their grandparents.
    Those generations rode an upward wave that their leaders said wouldn''t crest
    anytime soon because &quot;everything is awesome&quot; and what not. It sure does
    seem like the playing field has changed a lot, and not in favor of huge groups
    of people. So yeah, there is opportunity, if you can dodge the cops, borrow $100k
    and wait until you''re 46 to buy a house. {icon_wink.gif} So, can Trump fix this?
    Nope. Wreckage will come, then war and cleanup, just like every other society
    in human history, ever. Hopefully after we are dead, but who knows? My point is
    that there are a large number of Americans who do not think things are fine. Some
    of their gripes are legit. Whether they are right or not, who knows? Time will
    tell. The &quot;everything is fine&quot; crowd probably said, in 1937, that we
    have cars and planes now and everything keeps getting better. Then they got a
    lot worse. But as we have agreed on, the rise of Trump means a lot of people don''t
    think things are fine. By definition, when a large percentage of your country
    doesn''t think things are fine, then things are not fine. While those Jimbobs
    and shaquitas may be dumb, their parents were dumb too and on a playing field
    without any of the issues I described above, they had a chance for long term success.
    It''s less obvious that the next generation does and these are all recent changes.
    So I don''t worry about Donald Trump. He''s a clown. I do give more thought to
    the idea of a demagogue as a viable candidate, and I am slow, perhaps slower than
    you, to dismiss Trump as a one time thing. I''d rather deal with this demagogue
    and see him fail after 4 years, than the one that will come after 8 or 16 more
    years of Hillary (or rubio) type governance. '

    does and these are all recent changes. So I don''t worry about Donald Trump. He''s
    a clown. I do give more thought to the idea of a demagogue as a viable candidate,
    and I am slow, perhaps slower than you, to dismiss Trump as a one time thing.
    I''d rather deal with this demagogue and see him fail after 4 years, than the
    one that will come after 8 or 16 more years of Hillary (or rubio) type governance.
    But Trump isn''t going to help. Trump is personally friendly with the Clintons.
    Do you think he actually wants to do anything that would hurt them or their causes?
    Hell no. The major risk is that he might succeed, and turn the cold war on terror
    into a hot war to centralize power more. There are a lot of minor risks, too.
    Quote: Originally Posted by TheGillotine IMO, Trump will make these things worse

    issue. Yeah, like all these. Bernie won''t accomplish anything, because he''s
    also a clown, but he won''t try to make a huge power grab. And he probably won''t
    take us to war. That''s not in his wheelhouse. He''s the president who will fail
    after 4 years but maybe govern a little differently in the meantime. And make
    some actual attempt to help the working class kid. '

    Had he not gone after free college I think he may have had a chance. I like the

    of lower taxes for people who don''t make much. I like the idea of being able

    Don''t call it insurance and don''t claim people have some sort of ''right'' to

  pPost: 'We know now that what he says or does and how much he contradicts himself
    doesn''t matter to the mindless Trump supporters, but this one is pretty funny
    Trump in 2005 on outsourcing of American jobs overseas: Quote: We hear terrible
    things about outsourcing jobs--how sending work outside of our companies is contributing
    to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the
    unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing. I understand that outsourcing
    means that employees lose jobs. Because work is often outsourced to other countries,
    it means Americans lose jobs. In other cases, nonunion employees get the work.
    Losing jobs is never a good thing, but we have to look at the bigger picture.
    Last year, Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr. Lawrence R. Klein, the founder of
    Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, co-authored a study that showed how
    global outsourcing actually creates more jobs and increases wages, at least for
    IT workers. The study found that outsourcing helped companies be more competitive
    and more productive. That means they make more money, which means they funnel
    more into the economy, thereby, creating more jobs. '

    I can understand the other side. Any argument made ''on the other side'' would
    hinge on axioms that anyone who suggests &quot;killing their families&quot; as
    a reasonable option clearly doesn''t agree with. As I said, I don''t want to argue
    by just pointing out that not placing value on human life and cheering the murder
    of innocents on &quot;the other side&quot; is a heinous way of thinking. There''s
    certainly no logical argument against it. The best thing to do in terms of most
    efficiently ending the &quot;war on terror&quot; nonsense, is probably to just
    dump a nuclear bomb on the entire region. We''re at a point in human societal
    evolution where most people would not consider that an option, and arguing against
    those that do seems rather self-defeating. '

    http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/0...emacist/208985 Quote: CHRIS HAYES (HOST):
    Perhaps the most disturbing theme of the 2016 election so far has been the incidents
    of violence and verbal abuse hurled in the direction of protesters at Donald Trump
    rallies. Over and over again, with increasing frequency, over the past several
    months, often seemingly encouraged at the podium by Trump himself, these incidents
    are happening against the backdrop of two other equally disturbing phenomena:
    A growing list of avowed white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists,
    who have thrown their support behind Donald Trump; and Trump''s direct flirtation
    with white supremacists like David Duke, former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. [...]
    HAYES: Trump''s claim that he disavows Duke''s support hasn''t kept white supremacists
    away from his rallies. Yesterday another disturbing incident that brings this
    all together happened at one of his events. Several videos taken show a student
    at the University of Louisville over the weekend being pushed and shoved by Donald
    Trump supporters at a rally in Kentucky. [...] HAYES: Now thanks to some excellent
    reporting from The Daily News, we know that one of the men pushing that young
    woman, who is wearing a Make America Great Again hat is Matthew Heimbach, who
    confirmed his identity to All In in a phone call earlier today. Heimbach is an
    unapologetic white supremacist and neo-Nazi. A leader of the Traditionalist Worker
    Party, last October he tweeted &quot;Guess what, Jews, we''re back&quot; with
    a picture of him standing outside of the Holocaust museum. In December, he tweeted
    quote &quot;Donald Trump said he is not bothered being compared to Hitler, political
    correctness is losing its grip on America&quot; with the picture of people sieg
    heiling Trump. Earlier today he wrote of the incident, quote &quot;I''ll avoid
    any additional Trump events to ensure I don''t become a distraction, but white
    Americans are getting fed up and they''re learning they must either push back
    or be pushed down.&quot; Like David Duke before him, Heimbach understands the
    way the game is played. That Trump will have to distance himself from him and
    other avowed white supremacists. But the fact of the matter is Trump is their
    guy and they are sticking with him. '

    a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman.&#8221; As opposed to Trump
    who said: Quote: In December 2005, Trump wrote a blog post on the website of his
    now-defunct Trump University, and it was one big wet kiss to Elton and his groom,
    declaring their marriage a holiday-season happening to celebrate. Here is the
    full post: There''s a lot to celebrate this holiday season. Elton John married
    his long-time partner David Furnish on December 21. That''s the first day that
    civil partnerships between gay couples became legal in England under the new Civil
    Partnership Act. Elton credits David with helping him kick drug and alcohol addictions
    that nearly killed him. The pair has been together for 12 years. I know both of
    them and they get along wonderfully. It''s a marriage that''s going to work. .....
    This was from an anti-Trump website talking about how he isn''t really against
    gay marriage. I agree with the author. Yes you will find a lot of flip-flopping
    by Trump on the issue. Overall I don''t think he will get to involved either way.
    I don''t think he will bring in SCOTUSs with the idea that their ruling will be
    overturned. Os you can call him a flip-flopper and say whatever. I don''t really
    care and either do most people on this issue. It''s over except for a few hardcores
    still trying to hang onto to &quot;the good old days&quot;. '

    in 2005, when he was being criticized for outsourcing jobs Quote: We hear terrible
    things about outsourcing jobs--how sending work outside of our companies is contributing
    to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the
    unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing. I understand that outsourcing
    means that employees lose jobs. Because work is often outsourced to other countries,
    it means Americans lose jobs. In other cases, nonunion employees get the work.
    Losing jobs is never a good thing, but we have to look at the bigger picture.
    Last year, Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr. Lawrence R. Klein, the founder of
    Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, co-authored a study that showed how
    global outsourcing actually creates more jobs and increases wages, at least for
    IT workers. The study found that outsourcing helped companies be more competitive
    and more productive. That means they make more money, which means they funnel
    more into the economy, thereby, creating more jobs. I know that doesn''t make
    it any easier for people whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, but if a company''s
    only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it''s
    a necessary step. The other option might be to close its doors for good. '

    Whenever she sees erose and erose 2.0 deciding to derail threads by only commenting

    Some people do think he will do at least some of what he says, though. From Reuters
    on an uptick in illegal migration as people try to get in before the Trump presidency:
    http://www.reuters.com/article/us-us...ZSAPEC31DAFPE4 Quote: From the slums of
    Central America to close-knit migrant communities in U.S. cities, Trump''s rise
    to the front of the Republican pack has not gone unnoticed and is partly behind
    a spike in the numbers of migrants trying to enter the country, including children
    traveling without guardians. Interviews with migrants, people smugglers and officials
    show many migrants are trying to cross now instead of facing tighter policing
    and new policies to halt illegal immigration if Trump or another Republican wins
    the Nov. 8 election. &quot;If Trump wins, we''re all screwed and all Latinos are
    screwed,&quot; Isaias Franco, a 46-year-old from El Salvador who was deported
    from the United States late last year and is now trying to get back, said at a
    migrant shelter in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.
    The Republicans have been talking about the border for years, but no one ever
    took it seriously until now with Trump. '

    I think this is probably erosewater shorthand for some statement such as &quot;the
    average American still has an abundance of opportunity so how about less bitching
    and more effort if you don''t like your life?&quot; regardless of how you meant
    it, there are some glaring issues which are harmful to most Americans: -Endless
    war. Remember when there was no war on terror and every friggin'' football and
    basketball game wasn''t a bullshit tribute to Sergeant OneLeg being reunited with
    his idiot kids? I sure do. I remember being in the ****in Army and it wasn''t
    really a big deal to anyone. Or clearing security with a soda and my shoes on.
    No, the TSA doesn''t ruin the country. But a few trillion bucks on endless pointless
    wars is not good. -Absurd higher ed costs. It''s government policy that does it.
    -Endlessly jailing people, especially black people. -Police state issues. Hi NSA.
    Those are all, as you might say, objectively bad. They are not fine and not good
    and all relatively recent, when people like Hillary were in charge. There was
    no war on terror in 1995. Mass incarceration of blacks was brought to you in large
    part by a Clinton. And the NSA stuff? 15-20 years ago or so; it started before
    9/11. College was a hell of a lot cheaper 20 years ago too. I don''t blame Hillary.
    I blame people like her. They''ve been in charge. Wait, there is more. Other issues
    like wealth imbalances and inequality are a little hard to pin down. But they
    are real and they are due at least in part to a decision to bail out banks and
    endless low interest rate monetary policy impeding a clearing which would have
    made assets cheaper and allowed more people to participate in the post-crash rally.
    Now, long term asset appreciation is in doubt (because the 25 year downward trend
    in interest rates is over), higher education is unfathomably expensive, and asset
    prices, in the absence of much needed market clearing, are too high for many people
    to enter the market, especially those who borrowed money for college. Should these
    people suck it up and get to work? maybe. But their parents didn''t have to do
    any of that shit. Neither did their grandparents. Those generations rode an upward
    wave that their leaders said wouldn''t crest anytime soon because &quot;everything
    is awesome&quot; and what not. It sure does seem like the playing field has changed
    a lot, and not in favor of huge groups of people. So yeah, there is opportunity,
    if you can dodge the cops, borrow $100k and wait until you''re 46 to buy a house.
    {icon_wink.gif} So, can Trump fix this? Nope. Wreckage will come, then war and
    cleanup, just like every other society in human history, ever. Hopefully after
    we are dead, but who knows? My point is that there are a large number of Americans
    who do not think things are fine. Some of their gripes are legit. Whether they
    are right or not, who knows? Time will tell. The &quot;everything is fine&quot;
    crowd probably said, in 1937, that we have cars and planes now and everything
    keeps getting better. Then they got a lot worse. But as we have agreed on, the
    rise of Trump means a lot of people don''t think things are fine. By definition,
    when a large percentage of your country doesn''t think things are fine, then things
    are not fine. While those Jimbobs and shaquitas may be dumb, their parents were
    dumb too and on a playing field without any of the issues I described above, they
    had a chance for long term success. It''s less obvious that the next generation
    does and these are all recent changes. So I don''t worry about Donald Trump. He''s
    a clown. I do give more thought to the idea of a demagogue as a viable candidate,
    and I am slow, perhaps slower than you, to dismiss Trump as a one time thing.
    I''d rather deal with this demagogue and see him fail after 4 years, than the
    one that will come after 8 or 16 more years of Hillary (or rubio) type governance.
    Finally saw this (I tend to avoid these massive Trump threads), but {agreepost.gif}

    It is impossible to be an intellectually honest person and claim that Bush did
    not do everything he could to link the two, whether or not he explicitly said

    I''m honest when I say I don''t give a damn my brotha But yeah I know there were
    a few somewhat &quot;loose&quot; claims floating around like a supposed meeting
    of Atta and Iraq in Europe and so forth. And surely there were probably a few
    relationships. As you correctly alluded to, that is not what I was talking about.
    No claims were ever made that Iraq had any responsibility for 9/11 nor were they
    were harboring/ or had harbored al-Qaeda. At this juncture someone always seems
    to claim that 60% Americans believed that Iraq was responsible for 9/11 as if
    that means something. It doesn''t. '

    Congoese the same as our next door neighbor. You see this most clearly when we

    Parents make empty threats all the time. These people are bad parents. My parents
    never needed to threaten me but maybe that''s because they followed through when
    i was 3 and i just don''t remember it. I''m very careful not to threaten my kids

    What are you talking about, people would love to vote for the first woman president.
    They don''t know all that much about her because the past 9 months of political
    news has been non-stop talking about an evil con-man racist who bilks little old
    ladies out of their retirement money and calls people names, but they gotta figure
    she''s pretty good because she sounds pretty competent I guess and the only time
    I hear anything bad about her is from that evil, evil man who just calls her names.
    She''s married to Clinton, right? The 90s were nice compared to this. Do you even

  pPost: 'Spoiler: Quote: Trump and the Rise of the Unprotected: Why political professionals
    are struggling to make sense of the world they created. We******post can''t decode******re
    in a funny moment. Those who do politics for a living, some of them quite brilliant,
    are struggling to comprehend the central fact of the Republican primary race,
    while regular people have already absorbed what has happened and is happening.
    Journalists and politicos have been sharing schemes for how Marco parlays a victory
    out of winning nowhere, or Ted roars back, or Kasich has to finish second in Ohio.
    But in my experience any nonpolitical person on the street, when asked who will
    win, not only knows but gets a look as if you******post can''t decode******re
    teasing him. Trump, they say. I had such a conversation again Tuesday with a friend
    who repairs shoes in a shop on Lexington Avenue. Jimmy asked me, conversationally,
    what was going to happen. I deflected and asked who he thinks is going to win.
    ******post can''t decode******Troomp!******post can''t decode****** He******post
    can''t decode******s a very nice man, an elderly, old-school Italian-American,
    but I saw impatience flick across his face: Aren******post can''t decode******t
    you supposed to know these things? In America now only normal people are capable
    of seeing the obvious. But actually that******post can''t decode******s been true
    for a while, and is how we got in the position we******post can''t decode******re
    in. Last October I wrote of the five stages of Trump, based on the Kübler-Ross
    stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Most of
    the professionals I know are stuck somewhere between four and five. But I keep
    thinking of how Donald Trump got to be the very likely Republican nominee. There
    are many answers and reasons, but my thoughts keep revolving around the idea of
    protection. It is a theme that has been something of a preoccupation in this space
    over the years, but I think I am seeing it now grow into an overall political
    dynamic throughout the West. There are the protected and the unprotected. The
    protected make public policy. The unprotected live in it. The unprotected are
    starting to push back, powerfully. The protected are the accomplished, the secure,
    the successful******post can''t decode******those who have power or access to
    it. They are protected from much of the roughness of the world. More to the point,
    they are protected from the world they have created. Again, they make public policy
    and have for some time. I want to call them the elite to load the rhetorical dice,
    but let******post can''t decode******s stick with the protected. They are figures
    in government, politics and media. They live in nice neighborhoods, safe ones.
    Their families function, their kids go to good schools, they******post can''t
    decode******ve got some money. All of these things tend to isolate them, or provide
    buffers. Some of them******post can''t decode******in Washington it is important
    officials in the executive branch or on the Hill; in Brussels, significant figures
    in the European Union******post can''t decode******literally have their own security
    details. Because they are protected they feel they can do pretty much anything,
    impose any reality. They******post can''t decode******re insulated from many of
    the effects of their own decisions. One issue obviously roiling the U.S. and Western
    Europe is immigration. It is the issue of the moment, a real and concrete one
    but also a symbolic one: It stands for all the distance between governments and
    their citizens. It is of course the issue that made Donald Trump. Britain will
    probably leave the European Union over it. In truth immigration is one front in
    that battle, but it is the most salient because of the European refugee crisis
    and the failure of the protected class to address it realistically and in a way
    that offers safety to the unprotected. If you are an unprotected American******post
    can''t decode******one with limited resources and negligible access to power******post
    can''t decode******you have absorbed some lessons from the past 20 years******post
    can''t decode****** experience of illegal immigration. You know the Democrats
    won******post can''t decode******t protect you and the Republicans won******post
    can''t decode******t help you. Both parties refused to control the border. The
    Republicans were afraid of being called illiberal, racist, of losing a demographic
    for a generation. The Democrats wanted to keep the issue alive to use it as a
    wedge against the Republicans and to establish themselves as owners of the Hispanic
    vote. Many Americans suffered from illegal immigration******post can''t decode******its
    impact on labor markets, financial costs, crime, the sense that the rule of law
    was collapsing. But the protected did fine******post can''t decode******more workers
    at lower wages. No effect of illegal immigration was likely to hurt them personally.
    It was good for the protected. But the unprotected watched and saw. They realized
    the protected were not looking out for them, and they inferred that they were
    not looking out for the country, either. The unprotected came to think they owed
    the establishment******post can''t decode******another word for the protected******post
    can''t decode******nothing, no particular loyalty, no old allegiance. Mr. Trump
    came from that. Similarly in Europe, citizens on the ground in member nations
    came to see the EU apparatus as a racket******post can''t decode******an elite
    that operated in splendid isolation, looking after its own while looking down
    on the people. In Germany the incident that tipped public opinion against Chancellor
    Angela Merkel******post can''t decode******s liberal refugee policy happened on
    New Year******post can''t decode******s Eve in the public square of Cologne. Packs
    of men said to be recent migrants groped and molested groups of young women. It
    was called a clash of cultures, and it was that, but it was also wholly predictable
    if any policy maker had cared to think about it. And it was not the protected
    who were the victims******post can''t decode******not a daughter of EU officials
    or members of the Bundestag. It was middle- and working-class girls******post
    can''t decode******the unprotected, who didn******post can''t decode******t even
    immediately protest what had happened to them. They must have understood that
    in the general scheme of things they******post can''t decode******re nobodies.
    What marks this political moment, in Europe and the U.S., is the rise of the unprotected.
    It is the rise of people who don******post can''t decode******t have all that
    much against those who******post can''t decode******ve been given many blessings
    and seem to believe they have them not because they******post can''t decode******re
    fortunate but because they******post can''t decode******re better. You see the
    dynamic in many spheres. In Hollywood, as we still call it, where they make our
    rough culture, they are careful to protect their own children from its ill effects.
    In places with failing schools, they choose not to help them through the school
    liberation movement******post can''t decode******charter schools, choice, etc.******post
    can''t decode******because they fear to go up against the most reactionary professional
    group in America, the teachers unions. They let the public schools flounder. But
    their children go to the best private schools. This is a terrible feature of our
    age******post can''t decode******that we are governed by protected people who
    don******post can''t decode******t seem to care that much about their unprotected
    fellow citizens. And a country really can******post can''t decode******t continue
    this way. In wise governments the top is attentive to the realities of the lives
    of normal people, and careful about their anxieties. That******post can''t decode******s
    more or less how America used to be. There didn******post can''t decode******t
    seem to be so much distance between the top and the bottom. Now is seems the attitude
    of the top half is: You******post can''t decode******re on your own. Get with
    the program, little racist. Social philosophers are always saying the underclass
    must re-moralize. Maybe it is the overclass that must re-moralize. I don******post

    their role in it. Peggy Noonan WSJ Op-ed '

    a fundamental lack of understanding of the problem or even of his own solution.
    The centerpiece of his healthcare reform plan is &quot;get rid of the lines&quot;,
    and when he posted on his website what this means in more detail, he said &quot;Allow
    insurers to sell in other states so long as they are licensed in those states.&quot;

    a report in March or April 1990 saying people should get rid of those bonds because
    there is no way they''d be able to cover the interest payments. Trump went on
    a personal attack against the guy and got him fired from his job. The Taj Mahal
    defaulted on its very first interest payment 6 months later, the price of the

    as a Machiavellian conniver ever since the day she doubled down on her insistence
    that the Monica allegations were false (i.e. VRWC). She could easily have &quot;stood

    But there was apparent to me in her conduct at that time a calculated strategy
    for somehow parlaying her husband''s weakness into political gain. Then the carpetbagging
    to New York confirmed things. Then she''s Secretary of State. And then you have
    the email server, the Brian-Williams-caliber lies about Bosnia. And I would still
    vote for Hillary in a second over Trump. People I know who have voted Republican
    in every election over the past several decades, the kind of folks who send emails
    about how Obama is causing the downfall of Western civilization are seriously
    talking about voting Hillary, if Trump was the other option. '

    suspected terrorists, policies he has advocated while on the campaign trail. The
    switch, indicated in a statement to the Wall Street Journal on Friday in which
    Trump said he understood that the US &#8220;is bound by laws and treaties&#8221;,
    came two days after prominent Republican national security and military figures
    published an open letter on the subject. ... The question of whether or how the
    military could follow a Trump&#8217;s orders came up at the Republican debate
    in Detroit on Thursday night. Trump said he was a great leader and &#8220;frankly,
    when I say they&#8217;ll do as I tell them, they&#8217;ll do as I tell them.&#8221;
    He also said: &#8220;They won&#8217;t refuse. They&#8217;re not going to refuse
    me. Believe me,&#8221; and: &#8220;I&#8217;m a leader. If I say do it, they&#8217;re
    going to do it, that&#8217;s what leadership is about.&#8221; '

    Nomination is a LONG ways from wrapped up. Trump wears people out. He''s spectacular
    in short bursts but there is 90 more days of him. Rhetoric without substance is
    tiring. Highly unlikely Trump gets to 1,237. Won''t be surprised if Cruz avoids

    it does not require much understanding of Washington&#8217;s ways to realize that
    the gesture is in reality quite empty since the Chief Executive is unlikely to
    bear any actual consequences. As the government acts in loco populi in its increasing
    use of drones as the end game in a policy that includes kill lists, assassinations
    of American citizens and military action in countries with which the United States
    is not at war, there should be at least a modicum of both transparency and accountability
    to the process. In reality, there is neither and many Americans have no idea what
    is being done in their name. Most would be shocked to learn about the U.S. using
    drones for so-called double-taps in which a group on the ground is hit and the
    drone hovers while rescuers rush to the scene. The rescuers are then killed by
    a second wave of missiles. Apart from anything else, targeting those assisting
    the wounded is a war crime. The serious questions that should be raised about
    the use of drones have most often been successfully deflected by both government
    and an accommodating media which have diverted the narrative into an all too frequent
    technical discussion of the weapon&#8217;s capabilities... '

    So in this small area, Trump is actually a better candidate than Hillary because
    he doesnt hide it. Then this needs to become IMO the number 1 issue of the campaign.
    If we can''t make sure our candidate will not commit war crimes like this, then
    it really doesn''t matter to me whether we have universal health care, education
    reform, a strong economy, religious freedom, or a pluralistic society. If we are
    intentionally killing civilians in other countries, whether it''s a robot or a
    person holding the gun, none of that matters, and we deserve the retribution (internal
    or external) that will inevitably come our way. If we need to have hard conversations
    about the appropriateness and efficacy of &quot;total war&quot; and whether Sherman
    and Truman were both right, then let''s do it. But let''s not allow ourselves
    to make that a routine part of our foreign policy just because we can do it remotely,
    and because we''re afraid to demand accountability from our leaders. '

  pPost: 'More on John Kasich''s brokered convention strategy: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-kas...ed-convention/
    Quote: After Thursday''s Republican debate, where Donald Trump dominated much
    of the conversation, Ohio Gov. John Kasich laid out his path forward to the GOP
    nomination, predicting that a contested convention this summer will eventually
    stop Trump''s rise. &quot;Frankly, if I win Ohio, we''re probably gonna end up
    in a convention -- a brokered convention -- and then we''re gonna find out who
    the adult is,&quot; Kasich said Thursday in an interview with CBS News'' chief
    White House correspondent Major Garrett. The last time Republicans were close
    to a &quot;brokered&quot; convention, where no candidate has a clear-cut delegate
    victory, was in the 1976 primary between Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. &quot;We
    don''t have many states to be voting in,&quot; Kasich acknowledged, but he believes
    that &quot;we''ll hold our own in Mississippi, we''ll hold our own in Michigan.&quot;
    He predicted, however, that he would not win Michigan. He added: &quot;And then
    we''re gonna win in Ohio. It''ll be a whole new ball game.&quot; John Kasich:
    If I win Ohio, GOP will get a &quot;brokered convention&quot; When pressed on
    how a win in one state could change his prospects for the nomination, Kasich anticipated
    that Pennsylvania and Illinois would also be ripe battlegrounds for his campaign.
    Then, &quot;we''re gonna go to the eastern seaboard to New Jersey, Connecticut.
    These are places we are going to do very well.&quot; 2016 CPAC speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqIj1Bq1S6U '

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_...risoner_of_war Spoiler: Arrival On October
    26, 1967, McCain was flying his twenty-third mission, part of a twenty-plane strike
    force against the Yen Phu thermal power plant in central Hanoi[103][104] that
    previously had almost always been off-limits to U.S. raids due to the possibility
    of collateral damage.[101] Arriving just before noon, McCain dove from 9,000 to
    4,000 feet on his approach;[105] as he neared the target, warning systems in McCain''s
    A-4E Skyhawk alerted him that he was being tracked by enemy fire-control radar.[106]
    Like other U.S. pilots in similar situations, he did not break off the bombing
    run,[62] and he held his dive until he released his bombs at about 3,500 feet
    (1,000 m).[107] As he started to pull up, the Skyhawk''s wing was blown off by
    a Soviet-made SA-2 anti-aircraft missile fired by the North Vietnamese Air Defense
    Command''s 61st Battalion,[101][105] commanded by Captain Nguyen Lan[105] and
    with fire control officer Lieutenant Nguyen Xuan Dai.[101][105] (McCain was later
    awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this day,[100] while Nguyen Xuan Dai
    was awarded the title Hero of the People''s Armed Forces.[101] Decades later,
    Soviet Army Lieutenant Yuri Trushechkin claimed that he had been the missile guidance
    officer who had shot McCain down.[108][109] In any case, the raid was a failure,
    as the power plant was not damaged and three of the attacking planes were shot
    down.[105]) McCain''s plane went into a vertical inverted spin.[111] McCain bailed
    out upside down at high speed;[112] the force of the ejection fractured his right
    arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked
    him unconscious.[112][113] McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc B&#7841;ch
    Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he regained
    consciousness, he could not use his arms.[106] Eventually, he was able to inflate
    his life vest using his teeth.[106] Several Vietnamese, possibly led by Department
    of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore.[114] A mob gathered around, spat
    on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed
    with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area.[106][112][113]
    He was then transported to Hanoi''s main H&#7887;a Lò Prison, nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi
    Hilton&quot; by American POWs.[115] McCain reached H&#7887;a Lò in as bad a physical
    condition as any prisoner during the war.[115] His captors refused to give him
    medical care unless he gave them military information; they beat and interrogated
    him, but McCain only offered his name, rank, serial number, and date of birth[116][117]
    (the only information he was required to provide under the Geneva Conventions
    and permitted to give under the U.S. Code of Conduct).[105] Soon thinking he was
    near death, McCain said he would give them more information if taken to the hospital,[116]
    hoping he could then put his interrogators off once he was treated.[118] A prison
    doctor came and said it was too late, as McCain was about to die anyway.[116]
    Only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a high-ranking admiral
    did they give him medical care,[116] calling him &quot;the crown prince&quot;.[115]
    Two days after McCain''s plane went down, that event and his status as a POW made
    the front pages of The New York Times[92] and The Washington Post.[119] Interrogation
    and beatings resumed in the hospital; McCain gave the North Vietnamese his ship''s
    name, squadron''s name, and the attack''s intended target.[120] This information,
    along with personal details of McCain''s life and purported statements by McCain
    about the war''s progress, would appear over the next two weeks in the North Vietnamese
    official newspaper Nhân Dân[105] as well as in dispatches from outlets such as
    the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina.[121] Disclosing the military information
    was in violation of the Code of Conduct, which McCain later wrote he regretted,
    although he saw the information as being of no practical use to the North Vietnamese.[122]
    Further coerced to give future targets, he named cities that had already been
    bombed, and responding to demands for the names of his squadron''s members, he
    supplied instead the names of the Green Bay Packers'' offensive line.[120][123]
    McCain spent six weeks in the hospital,[103] receiving marginal care in a dirty,
    wet environment.[124] A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm,
    done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful;[125] he received an operation on his
    broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm.[126] He was temporarily taken
    to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, François Chalais, whose
    report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968[127]
    and later in the U.S. on the CBS Evening News.[128] The film footage of McCain
    lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly,[129] would
    become one of the most widely distributed images of McCain''s imprisonment.[127]
    McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese
    writer Nguy&#7877;n Tuân and Defense Minister and Army commander-in-chief General
    Võ Nguyên Giáp.[105][130] Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that
    McCain must be part of America''s political-military-economic elite.[131] Now
    having lost fifty pounds (twenty-three kilograms), in a chest cast, covered in
    grime and eyes full of fever, and with his hair turned white,[103] in early December
    1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed
    &quot;the Plantation&quot;.[105][132] He was placed in a cell with George &quot;Bud&quot;
    Day, a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot (later awarded the Medal of
    Honor) and Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain
    to live another week.[133][134] Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and
    kept him alive;[134] Day later remembered that McCain had &quot;a fantastic will
    to live&quot; Solitary In March 1968, McCain was put into solitary confinement,
    where he remained for two years.[136] Unknown to the POWs, in April 1968, Jack
    McCain was named Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC) effective in July,
    stationed in Honolulu and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater.[137][138]
    In mid-June, Major Bai, commander of the North Vietnamese prison camp system,[139]
    offered McCain a chance to return home early.[137] The North Vietnamese wanted
    to score a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful,[135] and also wanted
    to show other POWs that members of the elite like McCain were willing to be treated
    preferentially.[137] McCain turned down the offer of release, due to the POWs''
    &quot;first in, first out&quot; interpretation of the U.S. Code of Conduct:[140]
    he would only accept the offer if every man captured before him was released as
    well.[103][141] McCain''s refusal to be released was remarked upon by North Vietnamese
    senior negotiator Lê &#272;&#7913;c Th&#7885; to U.S. envoy Averell Harriman,
    during the ongoing Paris Peace Talks.[142] Enraged by his declining of the offer,
    Bai and his assistant told McCain that things would get very bad for him.[141]
    In late August 1968, a program of vigorous torture methods began on McCain.[143]
    The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged, painful positions
    and severely beat him every two hours, all while he was suffering from dysentery.[143]
    His right leg was reinjured, his ribs were cracked, some teeth were broken at
    the gumline, and his left arm was re-fractured.[34][143] Lying in his own waste,
    his spirit was broken;[143] the beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by
    guards.[103] After four days of this, McCain signed and taped[144] an anti-American
    propaganda &quot;confession&quot; that said, in part, &quot;I am a black criminal
    and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese
    people saved my life, thanks to the doctors.&quot;[103][143] He used stilted Communist
    jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced.[123]
    McCain was haunted then and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country,
    his family, his comrades and himself by his statement,[145][146] but as he later
    wrote, &quot;I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking
    point. I had reached mine.&quot;[111] Two weeks later his captors tried to force
    him to sign a second statement; his will to resist restored, he refused.[143]
    He sometimes received two to three beatings per week because of his continued
    resistance;[147] the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year.[135] His
    refusals to cooperate, laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards,
    were often heard by other POWs.[134] His boxing experience from his Naval Academy
    days helped him withstand the battering,[44] and the North Vietnamese did not
    break him again.[143] Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated
    in order to extract &quot;confessions&quot; and propaganda statements.[148][149]
    Many, especially among those who had been captured earlier and imprisoned longer
    ******post can''t decode****** such as those in the &quot;Alcatraz Gang&quot;
    ******post can''t decode****** endured even worse treatment than McCain.[150]
    Under extreme duress, virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their
    captors.[148][151] There were momentary exceptions: on one occasion, a guard surreptitiously
    loosened McCain''s painful rope bindings for a night; when, months later, the
    guard later saw McCain on Christmas Day, he stood next to McCain and silently
    drew a cross in the dirt with his foot.[152] In October 1968, McCain''s isolation
    was partly relieved when Ernest C. Brace was placed in the cell next to him;[153]
    he taught Brace the tap code the prisoners used to communicate.[154] On Christmas
    Eve 1968, a church service for the POWs was staged for photographers and film
    cameras; McCain defied North Vietnamese instructions to be quiet, speaking out
    details of his treatment then shouting &quot;Fu-u-u-u-ck you, you son of a bitch!&quot;
    and giving the finger whenever a camera was pointed at him.[155] McCain refused
    to meet with various anti-Vietnam War peace groups coming to Hanoi,[156] such
    as those led by David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, and Rennie Davis, not wanting to
    give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection
    to his father.[111] McCain was still badly hobbled by his injuries, earning the
    nickname &quot;Crip&quot; among the other POWs,[157][158] but despite his physical
    condition, continued beatings and isolation, he was one of the key players in
    the Plantation''s resistance efforts.[159] In May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense
    Melvin Laird began publicly questioning North Vietnamese treatment of U.S. prisoners.[160]
    On June 5, 1969, a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast
    that denied any such mistreatment.[160] The broadcast used excerpts from McCain''s
    forced &quot;confession&quot; of a year before, including a statement where he
    said he had bombed &quot;cities, towns and villages&quot; and had received &quot;very
    good medical treatment&quot; as a prisoner.[160][161] In late 1969, treatment
    of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved.[162][163] North Vietnamese leader
    Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards
    POWs.[162][162] Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that
    summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected,[111]
    and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast
    Asia, which included McCain''s brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs''
    plight.[164] In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Lo &quot;Hanoi
    Hilton&quot;;[165] his solitary confinement ended in March 1970.[166] When the
    prisoners talked about what they wanted to do once they got out, McCain said he
    wanted to become President.[70] McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside
    Hoa Lo with Spanish-born, Cuban psychologist Fernando Barral (es), that was published
    in the official Cuban newspaper Granma.[167] McCain talked about his life and
    expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam,[167] and Barral proclaimed
    him &quot;an insensitive individual without human depth.&quot;[168] The POWs issued
    an edict forbidding any further such interviews,[167] and despite pressure from
    his captors, McCain subsequently refused to see any anti-war groups or journalists
    sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime.[168] Release McCain and other prisoners
    were moved around to different camps at times, but conditions over the next several
    years were generally more tolerable than they had been before.[111] Unbeknownst
    to them, each year that Jack McCain was CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit
    to the American troops in South Vietnam serving closest to the DMZ; he would stand
    alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get.[169] By 1971,
    some 30******post can''t decode******50 percent of the POWs had become disillusioned
    about the war, both because of the apparent lack of military progress and what
    they heard of the growing anti-war movement in the U.S., and some of them were
    less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese.[151] McCain
    was not among them: he participated in a defiant church service[170] and led an
    effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light,[171]
    and as a result spent much of the year in a camp reserved for &quot;bad attitude&quot;
    cases.[151] Back at the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; from November 1971 onward,[172]
    McCain and the other POWs cheered the resumed bombing of the north starting in
    April 1972, whose targets included the Hanoi area and whose daily orders were
    issued by Jack McCain, knowing his son was in the vicinity.[173] Jack McCain''s
    tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972,[174] despite his desire to have it extended
    so he could see the war to its conclusion.[169] The old-time POWs cheered even
    more during the intense &quot;Christmas Bombing&quot; campaign of December 1972,[173][175]
    when Hanoi was subjected for the first time to repeated B-52 Stratofortress raids.
    Although its explosions lit the night sky and shook the walls of the camp, scaring
    some of the newer POWs,[175] most saw it as a forceful measure to compel North
    Vietnam to finally come to terms.[173] The Paris Peace Accords were signed on
    January 27, 1973, ending direct U.S. involvement in the war, but the Operation
    Homecoming arrangements for the 591 American POWs took longer.[176] McCain was
    finally released from captivity on March 14, 1973, being taken by bus to Gia Lam
    Airport, transferred to U.S. custody, and flown by C-141 to Clark Air Base in
    the Philippines.[177][178] Altogether, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in
    North Vietnam for five and a half years, nearly five of them after his refusal
    to accept the out-of-sequence repatriation offer. His wartime injuries left him
    permanently incapable of raising either arm more than 80 degrees.[34][113] For
    his actions as a POW, McCain was awarded the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit,
    three more instances of the Bronze Star, another instance of the Navy Commendation
    Medal, and the Purple Heart.[59][100] He also gained an appreciation, from experiencing
    the mutual help and organized resistance of the POWs, that his earlier individualism
    needed to be tempered by a belief in causes greater than self-interest.[146] Moreover
    it''s not like all he did was get captured, he did fight in the war and was pretty
    highly decorated before his capture (bronze star, etc). '

    Authoritarianism is not a new, untested concept in the American electorate. Since
    the rise of Nazi Germany, it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in
    social science. While its causes are still debated, the political behavior of
    authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders.
    And they respond aggressively to outsiders, especially when they feel threatened.
    From pledging to &#8220;make America great again&#8221; by building a wall on
    the border to promising to close mosques and ban Muslims from visiting the United
    States, Trump is playing directly to authoritarian inclinations. Read more: http://www.politico.com/magazine/sto...#ixzz42EVMFeRg

    Quote: NEW YORK (AP) - You could say politics has reached a new low with the &quot;small
    hands&quot; remarks from the Republican debate. But the exchange over the size
    of Donald Trump''s, um, hands is merely the most recent vulgarity in American
    politics. The history of crude remarks goes back to the Founding Fathers. In the
    18th century, John Adams called Alexander Hamilton a &quot;bastard brat&quot;
    and wrote that Hamilton had &quot;a superabundance of secretions which he could
    not find whores enough to draw off,&quot; according to historian Ron Chernow.
    One difference between then and now: &quot;These were words written or spoken
    in private, not in public,&quot; said Chernow, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning biography
    of Alexander Hamilton helped inspire the hit Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton.&quot;
    (Chernow says the comments were quoted in letters that survived the centuries.)
    In the 1880s, rumors of Grover Cleveland''s out-of-wedlock child led to a song
    from his Republican opponents: &quot;Ma, ma, where''s my pa?&quot; When Cleveland
    won the presidency, the response came: &quot;Gone to the White House, ha ha ha!&quot;
    &quot;Old-fashioned American politics was full of those kinds of vile comments,&quot;
    said Arnold Shober, who teaches government at Lawrence University in Appleton,
    Wisconsin. &quot;We''ve kind of lost that over the last 70 years, and I think
    it''s just coming back.&quot; Not that 20th century politicians shied away from
    vulgarities. Here''s President Bill Clinton describing his 1970s El Camino pickup
    truck: &quot;I had Astroturf in the back. You don''t want to know why, but I did.&quot;
    And Clinton''s Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proved that she could talk
    dirty when she said: &quot;This is not cojones. This is cowardice,&quot; after
    Cuba shot down Cuban-American exiles flying civilian planes. Fast-forward to the
    Republican presidential campaign. A week ago, Sen. Marco Rubio, talking about
    Trump, said: &quot;And you know what they say about men with small hands.&quot;
    In Thursday''s GOP debate, Trump said of his hands: &quot;If they are small, something
    else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem.&quot; Trump also has
    called Rubio &quot;little Marco.&quot; Sex therapist Judy Kuriansky said sex talk
    among men &quot;is their way of comparing themselves and evaluating their influence
    and their power over each other. Certainly that was the allusion&quot; at the
    debate. &quot;Everything is related to potency and power in direct relationship
    to size,&quot; she added. &quot;I''m taller than you and my penis is bigger than
    you and therefore I''m more powerful than you.&quot; What do voters think? Those
    who like Trump seem to give it a pass. Those who don''t are disgusted. &quot;There''s
    too much political correctness,&quot; said Trump supporter Carol Ebright at a
    Trump rally in Cadillac, Michigan, on Friday. &quot;I want to see the ''Get things
    done!'' not the ''Did you hear what he said?''&quot; She carried a sign that said:
    &quot;The silent majority stands with Trump.&quot; But Amy Woody, a self-described
    moderate-to-liberal voter from eastern Tennessee, said Trump''s crude language
    is &quot;completely inappropriate.&quot; &quot;I have extremely thick skin,&quot;
    said Woody, who spent 16 years in the U.S. Air Force in squadrons that were typically
    less than 20 percent female. &quot;I served in the military for a long time. We
    probably joked much more inappropriately than your standard workplace. It''s not
    done with any malice or disrespect. Male, female, it doesn''t matter. You all
    just wear a uniform. We all dish out the same comments to each other.&quot; But
    in a presidential campaign, she said, &quot;it''s tacky and trashy, and I think
    all politicians, especially someone running for president, should have at least
    a trace of class and dignity.&quot; Just because Trump can get away with it, though,
    doesn''t mean the rest of us can. Using crude language or mocking others in the
    workplace can get you reprimanded, fired or sued. &quot;That type of comment in
    the workplace could be viewed as offensive and creating a hostile work environment,&quot;
    said Richard Corenthal, a labor and employment lawyer with Meyer Suozzi English
    &amp; Klein in New York. &quot;An employer may be liable if put on notice about
    these types of comments and if they allow them to continue.&quot; Whether legal
    or not, whether appropriate or not, one thing is clear: Trump''s comments don''t
    represent some grand fall in decorum. Political mudslinging has gone on for centuries
    and our tolerance for vulgarities has built up over time. &quot;Politics has emerged
    as essentially a reality TV show, and that''s why Trump is able to use it so deftly:
    He understands the format. He built his campaign around it,&quot; said Andrew
    Ricci, vice president of Levick, a Washington, D.C. public relations firm. At
    the New York State Republican convention in Buffalo, Friday, Pamela Helming, town
    supervisor of Canandaigua, New York, worried that the GOP candidates'' bickering
    &quot;is just going to turn people off and we''re not going to see the voters
    turn out.&quot; She added: &quot;Some of the crude comments, you expect some bickering,
    some negativity, but I do believe they''ve crossed a line.&quot; '

    killed people for insulting his wife. Quote: Jackson and Dickinson were rival
    horse breeders and southern plantation owners with a long-standing hatred of each
    other. Dickinson accused Jackson of reneging on a horse bet, calling Jackson a
    coward and an equivocator. Dickinson also called Rachel Jackson a bigamist. (Rachel
    had married Jackson not knowing her first husband had failed to finalize their
    divorce.) After the insult to Rachel and a statement published in the National
    Review in which Dickinson called Jackson a worthless scoundrel and, again, a coward,
    Jackson challenged Dickinson to a duel. On May 30, 1806, Jackson and Dickinson
    met at Harrison******post can''t decode******s Mills on the Red River in Logan,
    Kentucky. At the first signal from their seconds, Dickinson fired. Jackson received
    Dickinson******post can''t decode******s first bullet in the chest next to his
    heart. Jackson put his hand over the wound to staunch the flow of blood and stayed
    standing long enough to fire his gun. Dickinson******post can''t decode******s
    seconds claimed Jackson******post can''t decode******s first shot misfired, which
    would have meant the duel was over, but, in a breach of etiquette, Jackson re-cocked
    the gun and shot again, this time killing his opponent. Although Jackson recovered,
    he suffered chronic pain from the wound for the remainder of his life. If Trump
    challenges Rubio to a literal cage match I might change my mind. '

  pPost: 'This is why Trump''s &quot;If 65% of Republicans don''t like me, then 85%
    of Republicans don''t like you!&quot; is somewhat nonsense. http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/m...-primary-2016/
    Quote: PPP''s newest Ohio poll finds a very close race on the Republican side-
    with Donald Trump slightly ahead but perhaps more reasons within the numbers to
    think that John Kasich will end up winning the state. Trump leads with 38% to
    35% for Kasich, 15% for Ted Cruz, and just 5% for Marco Rubio. The race is pretty
    fluid though, with only 69% of voters saying they''re committed to their current
    choice, and 31% saying they might change their minds between now and next Tuesday.
    If voters do change their minds- especially supporters of Cruz and Rubio who appear
    to have little chance of being competitive in the state- Kasich is likely to be
    the beneficiary. Kasich leads Trump 55/40 if voters had to choose just between
    the two of them. Rubio voters move to Kasich 75/16 over Trump, Cruz voters do
    so 69/25, and undecideds would pick him 54/11 if Kasich and Trump ended up being
    the two candidates they chose between. Kasich is also by far the most broadly
    popular of the candidates in Ohio with a 70/22 favorability rating- only Trump
    at 48/44 is also on positive ground among the remaining candidates. If more strategic
    voting happens in the next week, Kasich is likely to be the beneficiary. Kasich
    leads Trump with both moderates (43/39) and ''somewhat conservative'' (39/36)
    voters. Trump is ahead because he has 40% with ''very conservative'' voters to
    25% for Cruz with Kasich coming in third at 23%. There''s also a gender split
    in the race with Kasich up 36/33 among women but Trump making up for it with a
    42/34 advantage among men. '

    Nice! Quote: &#8220;There was much unhappiness about his emergence, a good deal
    of talk, some of it insightful and thoughtful, about why he&#8217;s done so well,
    and many expressions of hope that he would be defeated,&#8221; Weekly Standard
    editor Bill Kristol wrote in an emailed report that the Huffington Post obtained
    and that borrowed from unlikely source material &#8212; Karl Marx&#8217;s &#8220;The
    Communist Manifesto.&#8221; Unlikely? {lol.gif} Quote: &#8220;The key task now
    &#8230; is less to understand Trump than to stop him,&#8221; Kristol continued.
    &#8220;In general, there&#8217;s a little too much hand-wringing, brow-furrowing,
    and fatalism out there and not quite enough resolving to save the party from nominating
    or the country electing someone who simply shouldn&#8217;t be president.&#8221;
    I for one am sick of Presidents who are the kind of people who should be President. '

    I just don''t understand the whole idea of the &quot;downside&quot;. The economy
    is going to tank? Who on this board lost a job in the recent recession? Probably
    not too many of you. Is the economy going to be worse than that? Hard to imagine
    Trump igniting a recession which is so bad that the treasury and Federal Reserve
    has to take extraordinary measures to prevent total collapse. Economy will go
    up and down, actuaries are practically a guild of esoteric but needed skills.
    Is Trump going to start a big war? I think the establishment more or less has
    the lock on endless wars and boundless military spending. So how is Trump going
    to be worse there? I guess if you''re an undocumented immigrant, Trump is going
    to make your life worse. Is anyone on here and undocumented immigrant? I don''t
    think so. There are plenty of philosophical reasons to be opposed to a trump candidacy,
    or presidency. But an actual &quot;downside&quot;? Fear mongering IMO '

    eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my God, I can''t believe
    it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. It''s terrible. It''s

    2+2 is? I''ll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way, I love the number
    2. It''s probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what,
    it''s probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot.
    If I''m being honest, I mean, if I''m being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except
    for Marco Rubio, now he''s a zero that I don''t like. Though, I probably shouldn''t

    I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers, and we can add them and subtract
    them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide

    At least a dozen Congressional Republicans &#8211; along with Silicon Valley''s
    top dogs&#8211; attended an off-the-record conference at a swanky Georgia retreat
    and discussed how they might derail Donald Trump''s bid for the presidency. The
    Huffington Post tracked down a number of attendees of this year''s World Forum,
    hosted by the right-leaning think tank the American Enterprise Institute and held
    at the opulent Sea Island resort over the weekend. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google
    co-founder Larry Page, Napster creator Sean Parker and Tesla Motors and SpaceX
    boss Elon Musk gathered at the confab alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate
    Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, longtime GOP strategist Karl Rove and many more.
    The No. 1 topic of discussion, the Huffington Post wrote, was how to stop Trump
    in his tracks. I mean, I guess this is attack line we''re at now since ''Trump
    isn''t rich'' and ''Trump isn''t a Republican'' haven''t gained any traction either.
    He''s really just the ultimate establishment insider. I''m sure this will catch. '

  pPost: 'Trump sued a journalist when he knew he couldn''t win, solely to try and
    harm him financially Quote: Trump said in an interview that he knew he couldn&#8217;t
    win the suit but brought it anyway to make a point. &#8220;I spent a couple of
    bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life
    miserable, which I&#8217;m happy about.&#8221; https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifes...7b7_story.html
    The whole thing is full of gems Quote: Donald Trump said last month that he wants
    to &#8220;open up&#8221; the nation&#8217;s libel laws to make it easier for public
    figures to sue the news media. The Republican Party&#8217;s leading candidate
    may have been speaking from personal experience: Trump has already sued a journalist
    for libel &#8212; and lost in humiliating fashion. Trump went to court in early
    2006, claiming that he had been libeled in the book &#8220;TrumpNation: The Art
    of Being The Donald,&#8221; by Timothy L. O&#8217;Brien, then a business reporter
    at the New York Times. The book briefly addressed Trump&#8217;s claims about his
    net worth, which was then, as it is now, the subject of a great deal of bluster,
    speculation and opacity. O&#8217;Brien concluded that Trump was worth substantially
    less than what Trump publicly claimed, an assertion that prompted the business
    mogul to sue O&#8217;Brien and his publisher, Warner Books. He claimed harm to
    his business and sought $5 billion in damages. The lawsuit is one of many that
    Trump has leveled at adversaries and former business partners over the years.
    But this one may have gone straight to the heart of Trump&#8217;s &#8220;brand.&#8221;
    Trump pursued it for five years, spending more than $1 million in legal fees,
    apparently to protect a fundamental aspect of his identity and mythos: That he
    is not merely very rich but clearly, most sincerely, super rich. More than a decade
    later, the issue still clearly stings Trump. O&#8217;Brien, he said in an interview
    Tuesday, &#8220;is a whack job, a total nut job .&#8201;.&#8201;. one of the sleaziest
    people I&#8217;ve ever done business with. He wrote a book knowing it was totally
    false. He didn&#8217;t know what the assets were, and he disregarded their value.
    He really did set out with the intent to harm.&#8221; To Trump&#8217;s great exasperation,
    O&#8217;Brien showed that there are good reasons to doubt Trump&#8217;s assertion
    that he was worth &#8220;five to six billion&#8221; dollars in 2005. (In a campaign-disclosure
    form filed in July, Trump claimed he is now worth more than $10 billion.) Based
    on documents and interviews with Trump and his associates, O&#8217;Brien estimated
    that Trump had inflated his bankroll as much as 20 times over. Subtracting debts
    and other liabilities, O&#8217;Brien says, Trump&#8217;s net worth was pegged
    at $150 million to $250 million, based on estimates by people with direct knowledge
    of Trump&#8217;s finances. The suit may have settled the basic question &#8212;
    what is Trump worth? &#8212; but the public never got a glimpse of the answer.
    Trump supplied records and documents, including tax returns that he has declined
    to release during his campaign, but those were sealed by the court. In any case,
    Trump was unable to show that O&#8217;Brien had acted with &#8220;reckless disregard&#8221;
    for the truth, the standard for sustaining a libel claim against a public figure.
    &#8220;We blew him up on the whole notion that I set out with reckless disregard
    and malice,&#8221; says O&#8217;Brien, now the editor of Bloomberg View. &#8220;My
    lawyers drew and quartered him&#8221; on that issue. The limited public record
    of the lawsuit includes interesting revelations. One is Trump&#8217;s admission,
    under questioning from O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s attorneys during a deposition, that
    he relied on his own &#8220;feelings&#8221; to assess the value of his holdings.
    An attorney asked: Feelings? &#8220;Yes, even my own feelings as to where the
    world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day,&#8221;
    Trump said, according to the court record. &#8220;Then you have a September 11th,
    and you don&#8217;t feel so good about yourself and you don&#8217;t feel so good
    about the world and you don&#8217;t feel so good about New York City. Then you
    have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after that
    it was a different feeling. So yeah, even my own feelings affect my value to myself.&#8221;
    The statement effectively validated O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s skeptical take on Trump&#8217;s
    self-reporting, which O&#8217;Brien characterized as Trump&#8217;s &#8220;verbal
    billions.&#8221; A superior court judge in New Jersey ruled that Trump had no
    case and dismissed his suit in 2009. An appeals court affirmed that decision two
    years later. Ultimately, Trump rationalized his defeat this way: &#8220;Essentially
    the judge just said, &#8216;Trump is too famous,&#8217;&#8201;&#8221; he told
    the Atlantic magazine in 2013. &#8220; &#8216;He&#8217;s so famous that you&#8217;re
    allowed to say anything you want about him.&#8217; Well, I disagree with that.&#8221;
    Well, not exactly. Both courts cited a lack of &#8220;clear and convincing&#8221;
    evidence to satisfy the basic legal test for libeling someone as well known as
    Trump: willful disregard for the truth. The appeals court noted O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s
    diligent and extensive efforts to research Trump&#8217;s wealth. Trump said in
    an interview that he knew he couldn&#8217;t win the suit but brought it anyway
    to make a point. &#8220;I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent
    a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which I&#8217;m happy about.&#8221;
    O&#8217;Brien notes that his reporting on Trump&#8217;s wealth consisted of only
    a few pages of his 288-page book, which was rife with passages about Trump&#8217;s
    &#8220;checkered&#8221; business career. So why did Trump ignore the rest and
    take such offense at the net-worth discussion? &#8220;It&#8217;s a measure of
    his deep insecurity,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said. &#8220;His wealth and the size
    of his wealth .&#8201;.&#8201;. are integral to how he wants people to perceive
    him. He looks at the Forbes 400[list of wealthiest Americans] as the pecking order,
    and his ego and standing are wrapped up in it. People who are comfortable with
    their wealth don&#8217;t need to brag about it. He&#8217;s not in that category.&#8221;
    As it happens, Trump&#8217;s lawsuit and the publicity surrounding it did little
    to help &#8220;TrumpNation.&#8221; The book &#8220;didn&#8217;t sell particularly
    well,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said. Trump takes some credit for that. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
    read the book,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have time to read it. What
    I did do was make sure people knew it was false.&#8221; But the author did get
    one last laugh. In a two-can-play-at-this-game column last year, he facetiously
    asserted that he, like Trump, was personally worth $10 billion. How did he make
    such an extraordinary figure? Among other things, O&#8217;Brien assessed his home
    at $6 billion, his aging Ford Escape at $3 billion, and his son&#8217;s Pokemon
    card collection at $100 million. Absurd, yes. But that&#8217;s how rich he personally
    felt at the time. '

    before it truly came to an end? 11 years into Vietnam, and no one could have possibly
    conceived of a long-standing foreign policy carried on by successive presidents.
    Um -A president starts a war based on obvious lies -Gets re elected despite lies
    being proven as such -New guy runs and wins essentially on not being that war
    starter guy -New guy gets peace prize because he''s not the previous guy -New
    guy then has same foreign policy as guy who he campaigned on not being -new guys
    sec of state is next nominee against a demagogue who appears to be making up his
    campaign as he goes along And people are surprised that the prevailing sentiment
    is &quot;burn it down&quot;? Wtf were you talking about again? '

    Lots of gems in there. My favorite one is the Tilted Kilt waitress going into
    law enforcement, and this chick who is worried about all the black criminals in
    Cedar Rapids and obamacare Spoiler: I work at a lip-balm factory. I used to work
    for Ricoh, the copy-maker. When my area lost two contracts, there was no need
    for my role anymore. Six months of wondering if I was going to get a job. It was
    really difficult, especially when you******post can''t decode******re in your
    late 40s. I went on unemployment. My health care has gone to shit. I had to go
    to a high deductible because I can******post can''t decode******t afford $240
    a month. This is Obamacare. I******post can''t decode******m also an Army mom.
    My daughter was a Kiowa-helicopter tech, served for nine months in Afghanistan.
    But she is not finding a job now. Taking care of veterans is at the top of my
    list. I really care about getting our country back to where it******post can''t
    decode******s supposed to be. As soon as Trump came on the field, I was there.
    This is who I want. I didn******post can''t decode******t look at anybody else.
    It******post can''t decode******s just been The Donald. He speaks to the Americans
    that are genuine Americans at heart, that get what our country was based on. And
    Trump******post can''t decode******s for the *military. He******post can''t decode******ll
    straight up tell you that. Trump reminds me of Reagan. Reagan really lived what
    he believed. We have a president now that doesn******post can''t decode******t
    believe what he lives. He made promises and gave us great hope. Now we******post
    can''t decode******re getting that hope back. We******post can''t decode******re
    trying to get that change back to the way this country should******post can''t

    can''t decode****** and ******post can''t decode******God bless America.******post
    can''t decode****** I******post can''t decode******m tired of political *correctness
    all the time. We have contract workers that work with us, and a lot of them are
    Muslim. We have to honor their rituals. If they need to pray during the day, we
    have to allow that. There******post can''t decode******s something wrong. It******post
    can''t decode******s harder to be a Christian now in America. We******post can''t
    decode******re now the minority, and I******post can''t decode******m hoping Donald
    can bring us back to being the majority again. This is the other thing that I
    can******post can''t decode******t get my Democratic friends to understand: Bringing
    in these refugees, why are there so many men? If you want to convince me, where
    are the women and children? I don******post can''t decode******t have a problem
    with women and children. But we******post can''t decode******re not vetting them.
    There******post can''t decode******s just so much that I don******post can''t

    can''t decode****** Open our hearts for what? My other daughter is mixed race.
    She is pretty much a liberal. She has been ripping me up one side and down the

    You need to get out more.******post can''t decode****** Yes, black lives matter.
    All lives matter. There******post can''t decode******s a lot of black-on-white
    crime that doesn******post can''t decode******t get reported. And black-on-black
    crime is so huge. I mean, we can******post can''t decode******t go a day or a
    week in Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, or Dubuque without shootings. I did vote for Obama
    the first time around. Because I really was not happy with the Bush administration
    towards the end. The weapons of mass destruction were proven false; you kind of
    go, Okay, who******post can''t decode******s telling the truth? I met Obama in
    Dubuque. I got two hugs from him. I was very impressed. They were trying to move
    him along, but he really wanted to hear what I had to say. I said, ******post
    can''t decode******I******post can''t decode******ve been a Republican for many,
    many years. I think it******post can''t decode******s time for change.******post
    can''t decode****** But the man I******post can''t decode******m seeing in Washington
    now just doesn******post can''t decode******t strike me as the person I talked
    to. He wasn******post can''t decode******t doing what he said he was going to
    do. He was not ending what was going on in the Middle East. The gun-control issue
    is huge for me. I******post can''t decode******m getting my permit this month.
    I******post can''t decode******ve had a lot of bad stuff in my past. I was a victim
    of a sex crime 12 years ago. The police did nothing for me, said they couldn******post
    can''t decode******t prove anything. No matter how much therapy you get, you never

  pPost: 'There are so many lies in Trump''s post-Tuesday speech with his former companies,
    it''s hilarious. http://www.examiner.com/article/trum...usiness-record Quote:
    Donald Trump wants to get down to the meat and potatoes about his so-called failed
    business ventures. In fact, the GOP frontrunner, before last night&#8217;s press
    conference after the Michigan and Mississippi primaries, unveiled a table of well-marbled
    steaks, cases of water and about three dozen bottles of wine. Evidently, after
    winning another Republican primary, Trump wanted to celebrate &#8211; but also
    drive home a point. Namely, to defend his business endeavors that are increasingly
    coming under attack. Last week, Mitt Romney, the Republican Party&#8217;s 2012
    nominee for President, delivered a scathing speech undermining Trump&#8217;s past
    businesses. &#8220;Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,&#8221; Romney said on March
    3 while in Salt Lake City. &#8220;His promises are as worthless as a degree from
    Trump University. He&#8217;s playing the American public for suckers. He gets
    a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.&#8221; Romney continued:
    &#8220;Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then
    there&#8217;s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage?&#8221;
    asked Romney. &#8220;A business genius he is not.&#8221; Trump quickly struck
    back, again dubbing the former governor of Massachusetts a &#8220;choke artist&#8221;
    and mocking his 2012 campaign. &#8220;The guy ran one of the worst campaigns in
    the history of politics,&#8221; Trump said, before adding that Romney &#8220;chickened
    out&#8221; from running against him in 2016. However, according to NPR News on
    March 9, Trump doesn&#8217;t even own most of the products he rolled out at his
    Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida. The foodstuffs on display were meant
    to &#8220;prove&#8221; to Romney and everyone else that the billionaire&#8217;s
    businesses are just fine, but the bizaare move has only opened Trump up to more
    criticisms. &#8220;I brought some things up because, [Romney] said, &#8216;Water
    company is gone.&#8217; I said, &#8216;It is?&#8217; I didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221;
    Trump said. &#8220;He talked about the water company. Well, there&#8217;s the
    water company. I mean, we sell water. And we have water, and it&#8217;s a very
    successful, you know, it&#8217;s a private little water company, and I supply
    the water for all my places, and it&#8217;s good... Trump steaks, where are the
    steaks? Do we have the steaks? We have Trump steaks. And by the way, you want
    to take one, we charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?&#8221; But a little
    digging shows that Romney was not that far off. Trump Ice was a bottled water
    brand sold at national grocery chains. However, it&#8217;s no longer being marketed
    or sold, and its website has been deactivated. Trump does not own any natural
    spring bottling company. His water is bottled by the Connecticut-based Village
    Springs and sold at his hotels, resorts and golf courses. Trump Airlines barely
    got off the ground. NBC News recently summarized it this way: &#8220;Back in 1989,
    Trump pounced at the chance to buy the troubled Eastern Air Lines shuttle service
    for $365 million. He put the Trump name on the planes, dressed them up inside
    &#8212; and waited for business to boom. It didn''t. But the business took on
    too much debt and eventually defaulted. It was sold to USAir.&#8221; Trump Magazine
    used to be an actual thing, though it went out of circulation back in 2009. Now,
    a slick little periodical published annually by the Palm Beach Media Group appears
    at Trump&#8217;s hotels. It&#8217;s one of those flashy mags that sit next to
    the stationary that no one ever looks at. Trump Steaks sizzled out. They are no
    longer for sale, as of 2007. The ones Romney referred to were sold exclusively
    by The Sharper Image. A page on the company&#8217;s website says: &#8220;Unfortunately,
    Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures. And, whether you
    think Donald Trump&#8217;s candidacy is real steak or just sizzle, we hope you&#8217;ll
    enjoy this blast from the past.&#8221; Trump Winery? According to The Donald,
    he owns the winery &#8220;100 percent, no mortgage, no debt.&#8221; That&#8217;s
    appears to be a lie. The winery''s website say something different: &#8220;Trump
    Winery is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC, which
    is not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization
    or any of their affiliates.&#8221; Trump Mortgage folded in 2007. Trump Vodka
    is around, but reviews peg it as awful. And Trump University? Where to begin... '

    but that''s a very different thing. It''s actually another reason why he''s popular:
    &quot;look what these losers do when they''re in charge&quot;. There''s nothing
    to study. Trump''s campaign is part catchy slogan and part broken clock being
    right twice a day. trump is basically saying &quot;the other choices are garbage&quot;
    and the other choices are in fact such turds that this time, he is right. If Jeb
    wasn''t a bush, this probably wouldn''t be happening. Jeb was a highly regarded
    governor and is a smart guy with some appeal to immigrants. But his father and
    brother love starting wars for the Saudi royals and Americans are sick of that
    shit. Guilty by association. Nepotism in reverse. Either way bye Felicia Rubio
    is an obvious weenie who was crushed by Chris Christie, a man of no exceptional
    talent. Cruz is the jesus guy, probably a real conservative but that''s not a
    unifier. Sanders is a socialist and Hillary is the worst candidate of them all.
    so trump is like &quot;are you serious with these losers?&quot; And people are
    saying &quot;he''s got a point&quot;. Nothing to study. Broken clock. Trump will
    be fine as president. It doesn''t really matter to us anyway. Issue going to issue
    an executive order banning Excel? No? Then you''ll all be fine. {icon_wink.gif}

    11 bankruptcy. His stockholders were almost entirely wiped out, losing a staggering
    89% of their money. The company actually lost money every single year. In total
    it racked up more than $600 million in net losses over that period. Trump was
    chairman of the board throughout the entire time, and CEO as well for about half
    of it. This is the sort of record usually associated with an Enron or a WorldCom

    I can''t tell anymore when people are serious. From Forbes: Quote: Donald Trump
    has an estimated net worth of $4.5 billion as of January 2016, according to Forbes.
    In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show,
    The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management
    job in one of Trump&#8217;s commercial enterprises. The other contestants were
    successively &#8220;fired&#8221; and eliminated from the game. In 2004, Donald
    Trump filed a trademark application for the catchphrase &#8220;You&#8217;re fired&#8221;.
    For the first year of the show Trump was paid $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000
    for the first season), but following the show&#8217;s initial success, he is now
    paid a reported $3 million per episode, making him one of the highest paid TV
    personalities. Even at $3,000,000 per episode you don''t get to $4.5B very fast.
    Have you been to many major cities, his residential buildings are everywhere.

  pPost: 'He just makes shit up when it comes to valuing his net worth, and claims
    he owns things he doesn''t Quote: It''s one of the great mysteries of the business
    world: How much is Donald Trump really worth? The world famous real-estate developer
    and television personality has consistently said it''s in the billions. A 2005
    book citing anonymous sources said it was between $150 million and $250 million.
    Mr. Trump sued the writer for defamation. He alleged damage to his reputation
    that caused him to lose out on future deals in locales from Philadelphia to Kiev.
    A hearing in that case will take place Monday in a state court in Camden, N.J.
    As part of the proceedings, the Donald, as he''s known to fans and detractors
    alike, has provided under oath the secrets to how he values his wealth and treasure.
    In one case, he says, he does &quot;mental projections.&quot; &quot;My net worth
    fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings,
    even my own feeling,&quot; he told lawyers in the December 2007 deposition. The
    deposition, marked &quot;Confidential,&quot; comes to light at a time when some
    of Mr. Trump''s projects, including several condominium developments that bear
    his name, are struggling. Among the problems are anemic sales, lawsuits, sharp
    declines in value and troubles with creditors. In a telephone interview Sunday,
    Mr. Trump disputed that these are tough times for him. &quot;We have a lot of
    cash right now. We''re starting to buy things,&quot; he said while taking a break
    from playing golf at a Trump course in Bedminster, N.J. He said he stood by the
    statements he made in the deposition. In the deposition, given to lawyers representing
    the book''s author, Timothy O''Brien, and its publisher, a unit of French-based
    Lagardere SCA, Mr. Trump described his public persona. &quot;I''m not different
    from a politician running for office,&quot; he said. In the deposition, Mr. Trump
    said that his 2007 estimate of his net worth -- over $4 billion -- is &quot;a
    very conservative number, in my opinion.&quot; He also said $6 billion is a good
    number, counting his brand value. (In the interview Sunday, he said he was worth
    $5 billion, not counting brand value.) Mr. Trump was asked whether he has ever
    exaggerated in statements about his properties. &quot;I think everybody does,&quot;
    he said in the deposition. &quot;Who wouldn''t?&quot; A follow-up question: Does
    that mean he inflates the value of his properties in general, nonfinancial public
    statements? &quot;Not beyond reason,&quot; he said in the testimony. The deposition
    reveals he told his bankers and New Jersey casino authorities in 2004 and 2005
    that he was worth approximately $3.6 billion. In 2005, Deutsche Bank evaluated
    his net worth as part of underwriting a $640 million construction loan it made
    to Mr. Trump''s Chicago condo and hotel project. The bank said his worth was $788
    million, according to information presented by the author''s lawyers present during
    Mr. Trump''s deposition. In his testimony, Mr. Trump discounted that and other
    low-ball evaluations as &quot;ridiculous.&quot; And he noted, &quot;They [Deutsche
    Bank] still come up with numbers that are many times&quot; what the book''s author,
    Mr. O''Brien, reported. In his interview Sunday, he said Deutsche Bank looked
    at some of his assets, not all of them, and didn''t do independent appraisals.
    A Deutsche Bank spokesman couldn''t be reached. Mr. Trump said Sunday that Mr.
    O''Brien, author of &quot;TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,&quot; will
    &quot;wish he never heard of that God damn book&quot; and predicted that &quot;the
    publishing company will pay me hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; as a result
    of the suit. Mr. O''Brien, who is an editor at the New York Times, declined to
    comment through his attorney, citing the ongoing litigation. In the deposition,
    Mr. Trump discussed how he determined the value of a residential development on
    old rail yards on Manhattan''s west side. According to the deposition, when a
    newsletter reporter writing about the project''s 2005 sale for $1.8 billion said
    Mr. Trump had a &quot;small interest,&quot; Mr. Trump wrote him a note. &quot;You''re
    a real loser. Thanks for the nice story. Is 50% small?&quot; But Mr. Trump had
    a 30% limited-partnership interest in the project, according to legal documents.
    A group of Hong Kong investors were the owners. Asked about this during the deposition,
    Mr. Trump explained that, in his eyes, he owned half because he gets paid fees
    for managing the buildings and because he didn''t have to put up cash in the deal.
    &quot;In my own mind I''ve always felt that,&quot; he said. &quot;That 30% is
    equated to 50%,&quot; he said. In his interview Sunday, Mr. Trump said he had
    owned the equivalent of &quot;more than 50%.&quot; Mr. Trump often licenses his
    name to other developers in return for a fee or a cut of the sales. During the
    deposition, Mr. O''Brien''s lawyer, Andrew Ceresney, noted that Mr. Trump had
    claimed publicly that he had a major ownership in one such project. For example,
    in a November 2007 Wall Street Journal interview cited by Mr. Ceresney, Mr. Trump
    said he had sold out units at an eponymous condo-hotel project in Hawaii. &quot;The
    building is largely owned by me,&quot; he said in the interview. But in the deposition,
    Mr. Ceresney produced the licensing agreement for the project. Mr. Trump wasn''t
    a major equity holder in the project, it showed, a fact Mr. Trump didn''t dispute.
    &quot;Because this is such a strong licensing agreement that I consider it to
    be a form of ownership,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;I''d rather have this than
    own the building,&quot; he said. Moments later he said: &quot;I would say that
    it could be interpreted to be a form of ownership in the building.&quot; In the
    deposition, Mr. Trump is asked about the Bedminster, N.J. golf course, which financial
    statements showed had a net loss of $4.6 million in 2005. Has he ever done a financial
    analysis of his investment there? &quot;Yes, I''ve done mental projections,&quot;
    he said, figuring he''d eventually make $120 million. He never put them down on
    paper. &quot;You don''t really have to,&quot; he said. Mr. Ceresney, asks: &quot;Have
    you discounted in your mind for the risk that you won''t sell [memberships] at
    the prices you are anticipating?&quot; &quot;I think I will, but it''s possible
    I won''t. But I think I will,&quot; Mr. Trump said. At one point during the deposition,
    Mr. Trump explained the importance of putting his projects in the best light possible.
    &quot;Would you like me to say, oh, gee, the building is not doing well, blah,
    blah, blah, come by, the building -- nobody talks that way. Who would ever talk
    that way?&quot; http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124261067783429043 '

    The 62-year-old developer told Mr. O''Brien that he was worth $6 billion. But
    it emerged during the deposition that Mr. Trump had told his bankers and New Jersey
    Casino officials that he was worth around $3.6 billion. This all occurred around
    the same time period in 2004 and 2005. Mr. Trump said the $3.6 billion figure
    that he told the banks didn''t &quot;include anything having to do with branding,&quot;
    he said in the deposition. &quot;There are those that say the value of the brand
    is very, very valuable,&quot; he said. Asked if he keeps his net worth documents
    nearby, he said: &quot;I do keep one actually on my desk, hidden.&quot; In an
    interview Sunday, Mr. Trump said his net worth is now above $5 billion, not including
    the brand value. Quote: Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in November 2007
    that he sold all 1,282 units at his Las Vegas condo project that he owns with
    casino and hand-truck magnate Phil Ruffin. There were $1.3 billion in proceeds
    coming from that project, he told The Journal and other news outlets, including
    CNBC. In the deposition one month later, he said he had deposits for around 900
    units. Mr. O''Brien''s lawyer, Andrew Ceresney, asked whether Mr. Trump was caught
    in a lie? &quot;That''s not a lie,&quot; Mr. Trump said. He said that he was holding
    on to the rest of the units as an investment. &quot;I''m a buyer also, essentially.&quot;
    At the condo and hotel project in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump had told reporters on several
    occasions that the project sold for $1,300 a square foot on average. At the deposition,
    the lawyer, Mr. Ceresney, asks if that sales figure is true. &quot;For some units
    it is, yes. We got some -- we sold -- we got 1,300 -- I averaged on some units
    $1,300 a foot,&quot; Mr. Trump said. Mr. Ceresney then asked: &quot;Do you understand
    the concept of an average, Mr. Trump? Mr. Trump''s lawyer objected to the form
    of the question. Then Mr. Trump said: &quot;Well, I''m saying on certain units
    I averaged $1,300 a foot.&quot; Quote: One of Mr. Trump''s most prominent buildings
    is Trump Tower, the black glass skyscraper he built in the 1980s on Fifth Avenue
    and 57th Street in Manhattan. According to the deposition, in 2006 a Forbes magazine
    reporter calculated that Mr. Trump''s portion of the tower was worth $288 million.
    To do that, the reporter estimated the building generated $17.5 million of cash
    flow a year. The deposition shows, according to Mr. Trump''s internal financial
    statements presented by Mr. O''Brien''s lawyer that the building had a net loss
    of $587,730 that year. And including depreciation, amortization and interest expenses,
    the financial statements showed the operating income was about $4 million. Asked
    if he knows how to calculate operating income, he said: &quot;I don''t do that.
    I really don''t.&quot; Mr. Trump said in the interview Sunday that he stands by
    his answers and that he leaves financial reporting to his accounts. With regard
    to Trump Tower, he says a recent lease he signed with luxury retailer Gucci is
    one of the most lucrative in the world. In the deposition, he also pointed out
    in the discussion of Trump Tower''s income statement that the statement didn''t
    take into account that he occupies two and half floors there for his headquarters.
    &quot;I pay no rent, which you have to put a value on too, I guess; right?&quot;
    Referring to his three adult children -- Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. -- who work
    for him in Trump Tower : &quot;Maybe I''ll move my children into a less expensive
    location.&quot; '

    I don''t think anyone is alluding to that. He''s probably a millionaire several
    times over. Maybe a billionaire even? I don''t know. I don''t have access to that
    information. It is an important distinction though given that Trump gets a lot
    of support based on his supposed Business acumen and his net worth with and without
    the perceived value of his brand is probably the difference between the businessman
    that he wants you to think he is, and a reality TV con man who has dramatically
    unperformed a blind monkey investing in the US stock market. '

    I don''t really feel like looking up Hitler speeches right now but watch a video
    of him giving a speech (to the general public, not to the Party), and he will
    inevitably talk about some poor woman who was driven to suicide by the shame and

    hitler. He was a known political entity at the time, and he, and his party, were
    elected to positions of significant power. Hitler didn''t drop in from space with
    his death ray and enslave the German people. &quot;The Nazis&quot; did not spring
    from the trees of the Black Forest. They were regular ol'' Germans. They wanted
    him. Millions of Germans wanted him, and when he assumed near absolute power,
    there was no uprising. There was compliance. With that said it is worth asking
    how and why a Hitler came to power in a modern country, at least if you are going
    to draw parallels to a modern President. What were the conditions in germany in
    the early 1930s that encouraged Germans to choose this form of governance? In
    brief: -a tremendous economic depression -recent wartime losses (including loss
    of territory) -exclusion from the League of Nations -transfer of additional resource
    rich territory to France -demilitarization of much of the country It is pretty
    easy to see why a candidate who promised to make Germany great again was popular,
    don''t you think? Therefore it should be asked: -Do you believe that these, or
    similarly bleak, conditions exist in America? -Do you believe that there are sufficient
    numbers of people who DO believe these conditions exist? if the answer to both
    of those are no, then apologize for the hitler crap if the answer to either is

    spring from the trees of the Black Forest. They were regular ol'' Germans. They
    wanted him. Millions of Germans wanted him, and when he assumed near absolute
    power, there was no uprising. There was compliance. With that said it is worth
    asking how and why a Hitler came to power in a modern country, at least if you
    are going to draw parallels to a modern President. What were the conditions in
    germany in the early 1930s that encouraged Germans to choose this form of governance?
    In brief: -a tremendous economic depression -recent wartime losses (including
    loss of territory) -exclusion from the League of Nations -transfer of additional
    resource rich territory to France -demilitarization of much of the country It
    is pretty easy to see why a candidate who promised to make Germany great again
    was popular, don''t you think? Therefore it should be asked: -Do you believe that
    these, or similarly bleak, conditions exist in America? -Do you believe that there
    are sufficient numbers of people who DO believe these conditions exist? if the
    answer to both of those are no, then apologize for the hitler crap if the answer
    to either is yes, explain The perception of the economy is similar. The 1% crap
    has been stewing around for several years now. People think we are losing the
    country to Mexicans and Muslims. The situation isn''t 1 for 1 identical, but it
    is being driven by anger and frustration, and the desire for something different.
    Do I think Trump is going to going to exterminate a group of people? Not at all.
    When he compares Tiananmen square to riots and calls the response to that strong,
    and Putin a strong leader, does he come off as an authoritarian? Absolutely. His
    treatment of protestors and the media at his rallies are certainly consistent
    with these &quot;strong&quot; leadership ideas that have more in common with the
    evil H than they do any other candidate in recent memory. '

    I just wanted to point out that Trump bullshits numbers in order to fear monger.
    He absolutely is trying to create an unrealistically warped and negative perception
    of the US Economy. Since I find this interesting, I''ll continue to talk about
    it. The non-institutionalized population over age 16 is about 253 million. Labor
    participation is around 63%, down from a high of around 68%. Let''s say we want
    to ignore the fact that boomers are retiring and more students are going to college
    and productivity per worker has skyrocketed and all the other reasonable points
    that explain why LP has dropped. Let''s say it should be around 70%. So we have
    an 7% of the non-institutionalized population that should be counted as unemployed.
    So an additional 18 million. 18 million + 8 million (presently unemployed according
    to U3 methodology) / 177 million (70% of the non-institutionalized population)
    = 14.7%. Maybe we want to count those employed part time for economic reasons.
    Still not gonna get above 20%. Being extremely generous, I can''t even get close
    to Trump''s low end figure of 28%. So he is bullshitting and fear mongering, or
    he has better numbers than the BLS that he isn''t sharing with the rest of the
    class. I know which one I think it is. '

    fury into a successful political campaign &#8211; he was touting the talents of
    Manziel, Texas A&amp;M''s Heisman-winning quarterback who was headed to the NFL
    draft with the dreaded &quot;character concerns&quot; in tow. Of course, none
    of that mattered to the Donald, who took to Twitter to throw his support behind
    the kid known as Johnny Football. &quot;Teams are making a big mistake not taking
    Johnny Manziel,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;He is going to be really good (and exciting
    to watch). http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/n...nziel-20160311 Trump might be
    stumped. '

    Treatment Plan: Five Principles to Restore American Exceptionalism in Our Schools
    School Choice: I will actively support school choice programs, such as school
    vouchers and charter schools, so every student has the opportunity to fully realize
    his or her God-given potential. Empower Parents, Teachers, Local School Districts
    and the States ******post can''t decode****** Not Washington: In education, as
    in so many endeavors, the best decisions are the ones made by those closest to
    the issue. I will work to directly support students, cut red tape and reduce the
    size and authority of the Washington educational bureaucracy. Encourage Innovation:
    Everywhere I travel, I am inspired by the creativity of educators whose ideas
    offer real promise for tomorrow******post can''t decode******s students. Rather
    than micromanaging these educational innovators with one-size-fits-all regulations
    that suppress their ingenuity, we should promote innovative ideas in education.
    Reward Good Teachers: It is long past the time to give teachers the respect and
    the resources they deserve. Instead of an outdated system that rewards teacher
    tenure over performance, I will advocate for flexible block grants to the states
    to advance and reward teacher quality, and to develop teacher evaluation systems
    that focus on effectiveness in advancing student achievement. A Simpler, Streamlined
    Student Loan Process: The Department of Education needs to get out of the lending
    business. We need a simpler, more streamlined and transparent financial aid process
    that gives students and their families the kind of simple, reliable information
    they need to make good decisions. https://www.bencarson.com/issues/education/ '

    At one point they showed the Trump supporters around the arena -- mostly in the
    stands -- watching the protesters raging, tearing things up, getting in people''s
    face, etc. CNN did their best to blame that on Trump as opposed to the organized
    protesters. Their only valid point is that Trump probably needs to restrict who
    can come to his rallies in the future; violence is likely if he doesn''t, and
    it wouldn''t even be close to half the Trump supporters'' fault, based on what
    I saw tonight. Anyone else think these are agents provocateurs? Certainly smells

    That wasn''t a good look for them, and Trump will benefit as always. The event

    supporters primarily blame minorities and immigrants for their economic distress
    (with big corporations a distant second), while Sanders'' supporters place the
    primary blame on big corporations and are much more anti-racist and anti-xenophobe.
    Not to mention that the Sanders crowd includes millions of the religious and ethnic
    minorities that the Trumpians love to hate. If they''re ever going to be brought
    together, it would have to be by somebody running as independent or third party. '

  pPost: 'This article isn''t perfect and I can''t comment about the source (I don''t
    know much about the FEE), but it''s the first piece I saw (a month or so ago)
    highlighting some of the similarities in Trump and Bernie''s campaigns/supporters.
    Spoilered part of it below: Spoiler: We are actually living through a period in
    which the revolutionary left and the revolutionary right have merged &#8212; fighting
    the establishment to make government bigger &#8212; in a way that is mostly lost
    on their respective supporters. Sanders and Trump differ on particulars, though
    where exactly is not quite obvious. Yes, Trump is against gun control, and Sanders
    extols it. Sanders wants to pillage the rich, and Trump doesn&#8217;t want to
    be pillaged. Sanders makes a big deal about global warming, and Trump doesn&#8217;t
    seem to take it seriously. But those are the tweaks and idiosyncrasies in an overarching
    system on which they both agree: the nation state as the central organizing unit
    of life itself. They have different priorities on who it should serve and where
    the state should expand most. But they agree on the need to protect and enlarge
    state power. Neither accepts any principled limits on what the state may rightfully
    do to the individual. Even on big issues where one might think they disagree &#8212;
    healthcare, immigration, and control of lands by the federal government &#8212;
    their positions are largely indistinguishable. And yet, they and their supporters
    loathe each other. Each considers the other an enemy to be destroyed. This is
    not a fight about power as such but about in whose service it will be used. http://fee.org/articles/two-flavors-of-tyranny/ '

    to have long legs are not going away when Hillary (or Rubio, nah) wins the election.
    No one is &quot;uniting&quot; behind Hillary. In fact, understand this: No one
    is uniting at all, ever again, until you see a candidate who can appeal to (1)
    the hopelessly indebted younger crowd with mediocre career prospects and (2) the
    job-losing JimBobs. In theory a big terror attack could make a President popular
    again. Like Boosh in 2001. 91% approval for a while. Let''s hope that doesn''t
    happen. How''s the future look? Anyone''s guess, but: Ten years of sub 3% GDP
    growth plus an aging population predicts sustained low growth. This is the new
    normal until something changes. JimBob will still be JimBob. Except TPP and other
    deals will make his situation worse per the analysis posted in this thread. The
    student loan problem will get bigger, not smaller. These people are still going
    to be pissed off. JimBob and the hipsters will be pissed off. Pissed off people
    just need a nudge. Trump is not the cause of any of this. He is the result. I
    know you get this. I wish more people did. Congressional candidates will seize
    on Trump''s rhetoric to win elections in 2016 and 2018 and so on. Living under
    a debt mountain for a while can make you forget all that social justice stuff
    you learned in college, now that you''re 30 and still live with Mom, you know,
    maybe Mexicans are the problem after all. People are crazy if they think Trump''s
    defeat puts this genie back in the bottle. Nope. Hell nope. Eventually the climate
    for a trump-like candidate will arrive and the Sanders crowd will be getting out
    the vote. In 2016? probably not. But what''s going to change? Abuela to the rescue?
    lol. '

    may want to let your insurance know&quot;. Great. I drove up to Cocoa Beach to
    check it out. It turns out, Shaquita had not been paying for electric either.
    So when her power was shut off, her new boyfriend rigged up some kind of arrangement
    to steal power from a neighboring unit. Her new boyfriend was not an electrical
    engineer, no, in fact he was a crackhead, and his work was substandard, leading
    eventually to this fire. Property manager told me Ronda was gone and not coming
    back. She realized this was bad. Property manager asked me why I never evicted
    her. Was a no-brainer for me; didn''t want to put her kids out. Who knows what
    her next stop was? A shelter? A crackhouse? I wasn''t going to be the guy who
    put her kids in that situation. The neighbor had some damage and I paid for that
    shit, too, out of pocket. When we finally got into the place, there were dead
    roaches everywhere. I mean everywhere. Open up a cabinet and the shelves were
    covered with them. Property manager tells me they were live roaches, but she fumigated
    the place. She said it was so bad that when she walked in, they would drop from
    the ceiling. But, when you''re a crackhead like Shaquita Ronda, roaches don''t
    matter much. Her kids'' rooms had little glow in the dark stars and planet stickers
    on the walls and ceilings. Some other decorations were falling apart. It was pretty
    sad. So it cost me, all-in, probably about $23k to house Shaquita and her kids
    for a year, plus repair the damages. But please, tell me more about my opinions. '

    I don''t think Romney is actually campaigning with Kasich, he is just robocalling
    on his own. I wish he wouldn''t. The people campaigning with Kasich, to my knowledge,
    are: Arnold Schwarzenegger, who brought one of the biggest bodybuilding competitions
    in the world to Columbus Urban Meyer, hugely popular Jim Tressell, still hugely
    popular John Boehner, hugely unpopular Being pro-legalization is not such a bad
    strategy as you might think. If you hate illegals and want them deported, you''re
    with Trump. You''re not going to jump over to Kasich just because he starts imitating
    Trump. Kasich needs to use a distinct brand, &quot;Trump Lite&quot; would doom
    him. The vast majority of Americans and the majority of Republicans want a path
    to legalization/citizenship for illegal immigrants. '

    this year but I have been long before it was as big as it is today. Last I saw,
    kasich was up slightly in the polls over Trump in Ohio. I''m seeing Trump as a
    &quot;sink&quot; of sorts. By that I mean that he only gains support. He doesn''t
    lose it. Once people give up on &quot;traditional&quot; candidates, they migrate
    over to Trump and stay there. So the other guys can''t take supporters from Trump,
    they have to play defense the whole time and hope to keep their supporters, but
    Trump gets all the defectors. Has trump gone down in any polls by more than the
    margin of error? You were too quick on the edit. {icon_smile.gif} Agree that Trump
    Lite would not work. I am not so clear on this one though: Quote: The vast majority
    of Americans want a path to legalization/citizenship for illegal immigrants. I
    find it hard to believe that vast majority gives a shit. They just don''t want

    sure, if we were to meet, you******post can''t decode******d be a nice guy. But
    when you endorsed Donald Trump the other week, it was unlike any other form of
    political support you may have given before, and I******post can''t decode******ll
    explain why. It doesn******post can''t decode******t really matter, in the grand
    scheme of things, whom you endorse for President. You say you supported both Obama
    in 2008, and Romney in 2012. That******post can''t decode******s fine! Really,
    it is. They had opposing political views, sure, but there******post can''t decode******s
    nothing wrong with changing one******post can''t decode******s stance on a political
    issue. Plenty of people voted for both men at different times. But Trump, unlike
    any other presidential candidate since George Wallace (whom your grandfather endorsed,
    and who uttered the famous line of ******post can''t decode******segregation now,
    segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,******post can''t decode******) has
    built a platform based almost entirely upon racialist views, along with a long
    and disturbing history of racist statements. And you spent your first public endorsement******post
    can''t decode******not your first political contribution, but public endorsement
    ******post can''t decode******on him, surrounded by NASCAR drivers. He began his
    campaign by denouncing Mexican immigrants as ******post can''t decode******rapists.******post
    can''t decode****** He has said that ******post can''t decode******laziness is
    a trait in blacks.******post can''t decode****** He******post can''t decode******s
    insulted Jews. He******post can''t decode******s insulted Catholics. He******post
    can''t decode******s insulted Muslims. He******post can''t decode******s insulted
    women. He******post can''t decode******s insulted pretty much anyone with a shred
    of human decency. And that******post can''t decode******s not without even getting
    into his history as a pathological liar, which, whatever, he******post can''t
    decode******s a politician, and the bar is pretty low on that one. I understand
    you******post can''t decode******re defensive of your record on NASCAR******post
    can''t decode******s diversity program, and that you******post can''t decode******ve
    already spent ******post can''t decode******millions******post can''t decode******
    on it. Any amount of money spent is more commendable than no money at all, I suppose.
    But by endorsing Trump, you******post can''t decode******ve drawn attention to
    your efforts, which would inevitably draw criticism of the same. And it******post
    can''t decode******s not a huge leap to wonder why your efforts really aren******post
    can''t decode******t working. The reason why they******post can''t decode******re
    so blatantly half-assed, for lack of a better term, is your strange notion of
    what is considered fair in the world of racing. ******post can''t decode******It
    would be a conflict of interest,******post can''t decode****** your spokesman
    said in 2009, for NASCAR to be supporting individual drivers in the name of diversity
    while also adjudicating the rule book. And that******post can''t decode******s
    not an invalid point! It would be a conflict of interest, of sorts, if not merely
    an appearance of one, for NASCAR to be financially supporting individual drivers.
    But NASCAR, and the world of racing in general, has never been about fairness.
    To say that NASCAR is ******post can''t decode******fair******post can''t decode******
    is to live in a fantasy world. It******post can''t decode******s anything but
    fair. Do you actually believe that Dale Earnhardt, Jr., a NASCAR star, would******post
    can''t decode******ve made it to the top level of the sport if his father was
    a middling accountant, instead of one of the greatest legends NASCAR has ever
    seen? What about Chase Elliott, who appeared at the rally with you, and who******post
    can''t decode******s the son of 1988 Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott?
    What about Casey Mears, nephew of four-time Indy 500 champion Rick Mears? Or Brad
    Keselowski, son of former NASCAR driver Bob Keselowski? Or Austin Dillon, grandson
    of NASCAR team owner Richard Childress? Or Paul Menard, who has no real family
    history in NASCAR, but whose family name graces approximately 300 big-box hardware
    stores across more than 10 states, and whose logo graces his car? Or Michael Annett,
    whose father is the CEO of TMC Transportation services, which bills itself as
    the ******post can''t decode******nation******post can''t decode******s largest
    employee-owned flatbed transportation company,******post can''t decode****** and
    has sponsored his race cars throughout his career, up to and including his ride
    in the NASCAR Sprint Cup? Whether we like it or not, NASCAR success (and certainly
    racing is a whole!) seems to follow family connections and money to a degree unheard
    of in many other sports. Even Michael Jordan******post can''t decode******s kid
    couldn******post can''t decode******t hack it in college basketball. There is
    no fairness in racing. So to pull the plug on NASCAR drivers from non-traditional
    backgrounds, right as they take their first big step into NASCAR******post can''t
    decode******s third-highest racing series, is disingenuous at best. But if we
    bring it back to why you endorsed Donald Trump to begin with, you said it was
    because you were a friend of the Trump family, and you don******post can''t decode******t
    necessarily agree with all of his policies. I get that. There have been politicians
    I******post can''t decode******ve voted for, and likely will vote for in the future,
    who have policies that I don******post can''t decode******t agree with, either.
    And I get why you******post can''t decode******d want to support your friends,
    too. That******post can''t decode******s what friends do, right? You don******post
    can''t decode******t have to vocally endorse your friends******post can''t decode******
    political positions in the public sphere, though. I disagree with my friends here
    all the time on Jalopnik. It******post can''t decode******s okay, no harm, no
    foul. As I said yesterday, I am worried about the harm your endorsement will do
    to the future of NASCAR. Hopefully people will forget about it, and treat it as
    a momentary lapse of judgment. And hopefully, we can all learn from this one. '

  pPost: 'I have been complaining about pre-existing conditions since before ObamaCare.
    There are ways to cover it, but in a &quot;discussion board&quot; like this one
    I don''t think it''s worthwhile since 90% of the comments are sarcasm and lack
    any discussion at all. When I buy a whole new car it still looks a lot like the
    old car. Even though it''s completely new. Obviously any HC plan is going to have
    pieces that look a lot like the ACA to suggest it won''t is silly. To criticize
    it because it has similarities is also silly. I have heard several people complain
    about the ACA and how they saw rates go up. I also have friends who still don''t
    have insurance and pay the penalty. (I guess it''s not much). So again this nonsense
    that anything that is not Obamacare will leave all these people uninsured without
    consideration for those who would benefit is another dead horse. So for those
    who think the Trump ideas are so bad, what exactly is your problem with them?
    That it''s not laid out enough for you? What parts? Do you hate cross state insurance
    purchases that bad? Why don''t you think the pre-existing conditions can be handled
    some way other than mandated insurance? surely the dropping of people who had
    insurance when the condition arose can be fixed, right? If there is no individual
    mandate then how should pre-existing conditions be handled? What if someone moves
    to another state and starts their own company? '

    Trump stories? Seems as if radicals like BLM, moveon.org, illegal immigrants,
    and Bernie Sanders supporters should be the real story imo What''s the excuse?
    That Trump creates a toxic environment at his rallies? So of course the appropriate
    response is to send thousands of people over to taunt, disrupt, and start violence
    of their own, right? That doesn''t make sense to me. Let''s be honest, the main
    reason people are butt hurt are due to his stances on illegal immigration and
    Muslim immigration. His stance on illegal immigration is simply one of enforcing
    the law. And whether or not you think it is wise or impossible there is nothing
    unconstitutional about keeping out Muslims. If you don''t like the speech, then
    don''t listen to it. But disrupting others to hear it is completely un-American.
    And I''ll take a little masculinity every day all day over pansies and their safe

    {agreepost.gif} It was a bad weekend for Trump, imo. I think he''s trying to stir
    things up and get the attention back on himself, however negative that attention
    may be: First, he sends his son out to smear an innocent Bernie supporter (an
    old woman): http://www.thedailybeast.com/article...ump-rally.html He''s also been
    smearing that Breitbart reporter, and 3 Breitbart people resigned from the org
    - this may be seen as a win for Trump but it''s further chaos for the GOP. Lastly,
    he threatened Bernie Sanders and called him a liar, via Twitter: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-t...nders-rallies/

    The clear answer is of course disrupting. Do you disagree? Now you let me know
    how Trump''s &quot;support of violence!&quot; has anything to do with that. Yes,
    those things are all disrupting. Trump''s support of violence has nothing at all
    to do with that, which is why I did not bring them up in any way in my post. You
    brought them up, as I said, because it seems like you wanted to fit as much stuff
    that makes you angry into one post as possible without actually reading what you
    were responding to. If Bernie comes out in support of people taking massive swings
    at Trump supporters or jumping behind him at the podium, then I will be equally
    disillusioned with Bernie''s message. The issue isn''t how private citizens behaved,
    it''s how the person wanting to be our leader reacted to that behavior, and what
    it says about the direction his potential election would take the country in regards
    to this issue. '

    The clear answer is of course disrupting. Do you disagree? Now you let me know
    how Trump''s &quot;support of violence!&quot; has anything to do with that. Disruption
    in some way, shape, or form is kind of the point of an effective protest '

    think Bernie should tell his supporters to stay away from the inside of Trump
    events and to not get tickets when your only goal is to disrupt. OK another example.
    Someone disapproves of Disney''s use of H1B''s and decides to buy a block of tickets
    to Disney on Ice with the goal of stopping the show from occurring. Just some
    good old protesting? You can''t control how private citizens react, Trump can
    control how he reacts to their behavior. My issue isn''t with the guy punching
    the protester. I mean that guy is an idiot (the protester likely is too), but
    that''s pretty irrelevant. My issue is with Trump overtly supporting a violent
    reaction by suggesting he''d pay for this guy''s legal bills. That sends a message
    that Trump believes that sort of behavior is acceptable. Bernie is not offering
    to pay for violent protesters'' legal bills afaik. In my opinion, considering
    the recent events, Trump''s tweet about sending his protesters to Bernie''s rally
    implied that his protesters would be violent, not just that ''they''d protest''.
    Yes, you''re right, we can''t have everything we want. And as I said, it''s likely
    some people view this as less of an issue than I do. Personally, it''s very important
    to me that ''being unable to control your aggression'' is not perceived as a valid
    response and one that signifies masculinity. That''s why Trump''s reaction was
    much more problematic to me personally than many of his more controversial positions
    he''s discussed in the past. '
