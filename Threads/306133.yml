  pPost: 'Story time (taken from various wiki and other articles). It''s lengthy but
    has some twists and is pretty demonstrative of what I think is a problem with
    Islam: In June 2009, a Christian Pakistani woman, Aasiya Noreen, was harvesting
    falsa berries with a group of other farmhands in a field in Sheikhupura. She was
    asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well; she complied but stopped
    to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found lying next to the well. A
    neighbor of Noreen, who had been involved in a running feud with Noreen''s family
    about some property damage, saw her and angrily told her that it was forbidden
    for a Christian to drink water from the same utensil from which Muslims drink,
    and some of the other workers considered her to be unclean because she was a Christian.
    Some arguments ensued. Noreen recounts that when they made derogatory statements
    about her religion, she responded, &quot;I believe in my religion and in Jesus
    Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed
    ever do to save mankind?&quot; Later, some of the workers complained to a cleric
    that Noreen insulted Muhammad. A mob came to her house, beating her and members
    of her family before she was rescued by the police. The police initiated an investigation
    about her remarks, resulting in her arrest under Section 295 C of the Pakistan
    Penal Code (a blasphemy law). She subsequently was imprisoned for over a year
    before being formally charged. In November 2010, she was sentenced to death by
    hanging. Her village''s imam, Qari Mohammed Salim, stated that he had wept for
    joy on learning that she had been sentenced to death and said that some people
    would &quot;take the law into their own hands&quot; should she be pardoned or
    released. Noreen''s husband, Ashiq Masih announced that he planned to appeal the
    verdict. A month later, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who investigated
    the affair for the President Asif Ali Zardari, stated that Noreen would most likely
    be pardoned if the High Court did not suspend the sentence. Zardari was poised
    to grant pardon but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential
    pardon, which remains in force. Court transcripts show numerous inconsistencies
    in the evidence presented and reporters say they dare not repeat Bibi''s testimony
    lest they also be accused of blasphemy. In December 2010, a month after Noreen''s
    conviction, a Muslim cleric announced a 500,000 Pakistani rupee award (the equivalent
    of $10,000) to anyone who would kill her. Punjab Governor Taseer visited her at
    the jail several times with his wife and daughter, though Pakistani court officials
    later ruled that she could be visited only by her husband and lawyer. Out of concern
    that she could be poisoned, prison officials began giving Noreen raw materials
    to cook her own food. The Masihi Foundation, a human rights group, described her
    physical condition as &quot;very frail&quot;, and her health was reported to be
    in decline due to poor living conditions at the jail. She has also been threatened
    by other inmates and subjected to physical abuse from prison guards. On January
    4, 2011, Governor Taseer was shot 25 times and killed by Malik Mumtaz Hussein
    Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen
    and opposition to the blasphemy law. Seven months later, Taseer''s 28-year-old
    son, Shahbaz, was kidnapped, and is missing to this day. Another supporter of
    Noreen, Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, said that he was first threatened
    with death in June 2010 when he was told that he would be beheaded if he attempted
    to change the blasphemy laws. In response, he told reporters that he was &quot;committed
    to the principle of justice for the people of Pakistan&quot; and willing to die
    fighting for Noreen''s release. On 2 March 2011, Bhatti was shot dead by gunmen
    who ambushed his car near his residence in Islamabad. For 4 years Noreen''s case
    was continually delayed. On October 16, 2014 the Lahore High Court dismissed Noreen''s
    appeal and upheld her death sentence. On November 20, 2014, her husband appealed
    to Pakistan''s President for clemency. On November 24, 2014, her lawyer appealed
    to the Supreme Court. On July 22, 2015 the Supreme Court of Pakistan suspended
    Bibi''s death sentence for the duration of the appeals process. In November of
    2015, Bibi''s lead attorney, Naeem Shakir, announced that, after two postponements
    in 2015, the Lahore High Court would hear an appeal in Bibi''s case on March 26,
    2016. Last week, the man who assassinated Governor Taseer was executed for murder.
    The murderer''s funeral was attended by a reported 100,000 people. Here are some
    pictures. '

    written by http://subweb.diis.dk/sw127764.asp Tidbits: As we all know, Pakistan
    exists due to the religious partition of India when the British left. But, obviously
    that was related to the long history of Hindu-Muslim violence, with the Muslims
    being the minority. There was secular vs. religious threads from the beginning.This
    blasphemy law didn''t appear until General Zia''s Islamification push in the 1970''s
    (IIRC, Zia was a &quot;friend&quot; of the US due to his opposition to the Soviet
    Union, unlike the non-aligned Indians). The Pakistanis had an ongoing war over
    Kashmir, and viewed the Muslim Jihadists their shock troops (let''s say un-regulated
    militias) in that war, as well as their backup defensive army. There''s Muslim
    vs. Muslim conflict. We recognize Shia vs. Sunni, inflamed by Saudi Arabia funding
    the Madrassas that teach Saudi (Wahhabi) fundamentalism as part of the Saudi vs.
    Iran conflict. Of course there''s the Afghan vs. SU war, with the US funding the
    Muslim Jihadists, tribal areas that were never really governed by the supposed
    central government, etc. Long, complicated, lack of central gov''t power, teetering
    on a failed state. One poor woman becomes a temporary symbol for this battle. '

    I don''t undertand the point of this thread. Muslims gonna Muslim? Here''s an
    idea: if you are a christian living in Pakistan don''t mouth off about Jesus being

    can testify that you said something and that deserves a death sentence. It''s
    a witch hunt. It''s partly relevant because Muslim U.N. members are trying to
    export such laws and many Muslim immigrants support laws like that. It also might
    give people an idea of how popular such laws are and how difficult it is to fight
    for religious freedom in Muslim countries. Notice how the first instinct of some
    people here was to go &quot;Squirrel!&quot; and try to divert from the problem,
    or pretend that it has nothing to do with Islam, etc. Plus I thought it was a
    pretty interesting story and she has another hearing coming up this month. '

    about the Spanish Inquisition, which was a pretty nasty bit of Christian work,
    when the Christians in Spain were oppressed by, and less wealthy, less powerful,
    and less advanced than the Islamic world. You''re killing me here. I always thought
    the purpose of the inquisition was about (1) weakening papal authority in the
    Spanish empire and (2) confiscating property, especially from Jews. That second
    part is one of the reasons why Christopher Columbus''s ships had a lot of Jews
    on them. Re: property confiscations It is unknown exactly how much wealth was
    confiscated from converted Jews and others tried by the Inquisition. Wealth confiscated
    in one year of persecution in the small town of Guadaloupe paid the costs of building
    a royal residence.There are numerous records of the opinion of ordinary Spaniards
    of the time that &quot;the Inquisition was devised simply to rob people&quot;.
    &quot;They were burnt only for the money they had&quot;, a resident of Cuenca
    averred. &quot;They burn only the well-off&quot;, said another. In 1504 an accused
    stated, &quot;only the rich were burnt&quot;. &#8230;In 1484&#8230;Catalina de
    Zamora was accused of asserting that &quot;this Inquisition that the fathers are
    carrying out is as much for taking property from the conversos as for defending
    the faith. It is the goods that are the heretics.&quot; This saying passed into
    common usage in Spain. In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor
    had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified.
    In 1592 an inquisitor admitted that most of the fifty women he arrested were rich.
    In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal
    treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition''s own budget, amounting
    in one known case to only 5%). The property on Mallorca alone in 1678 was worth
    &quot;well over 2,500,000 ducats&quot; But wait, there''s more. Your characterization
    of nature of the Spanish Inquisition is probably bullshit. Two seconds of reading
    about this: The Spanish Inquisition is often cited in popular literature and history
    as an example of Catholic intolerance and repression. Modern historians have tended
    to question earlier and wildly exaggerated accounts concerning the severity of
    the Inquisition. Henry Kamen asserts that the ''myth'' of the all-powerful, torture-mad
    inquisition is largely an invention of nineteenth century Protestant authors with
    an agenda to discredit the Papacy. According to actual records the Spanish Inquisition
    was widely hailed as the best run, most humane court in Europe. There are records
    of people committing blasphemy in secular courts so they could have their case
    fall under the Inquisition&#8217;s jurisdiction. Further, the Inquisition was
    the first to pronounce Europe&#8217;s witch hunt a delusion and prohibited anyone
    from being tried or burnt for witchcraft. Other than that though it''s just like
    2016 Pakistan. (That''s two seconds on wiki) '

    speak about other issues related to Islamophobia and better understanding between
    cultures and religions; and I have to express here very clearly that we appreciate
    Russia''s position on this issue. We have almost developed parallel situation
    in the UN, in the Human Rights Council (HRC), in other international organizational
    organizations, where there is a full cooperation between the representatives of
    Russia and the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) countries. One good example
    in this context is the case of Resolution 16/18, adopted unanimously by the UN
    Human Rights Council in Geneva, which was built on the eight points proposed by
    me in 2010. It was an attempt from the OIC side to overcome the confrontation
    we had with the Western countries. The crisis had been started by the publishing
    of Danish cartoons - uncivilized ugly cartons - which, for no reason, attacked
    the revered and the sacred personality of our Prophet (PBUH). it is not whether
    you believe in him or not. You might believe in other religion; or you might be
    a non-believer. However, who are you to disrespect others? Why do you insult others?
    Why do you think that by insulting others you are expressing your freedom? In
    addition, when somebody comes and say: &quot;please, don''t insult my sacred values&quot;,
    you tell them: &quot;This is my freedom; I have freedom of expression; I have
    freedom of depicting and doing whatever I like; and you cannot stop me. This is
    against human rights, against freedom principals&quot;, This is really a twisted
    negative logic that is incomprehensible; that one exercises his freedom by insulting
    others, and not insulting just a few people, but insulting 1.6 billion people
    all over the world for no reason. Therefore, the OIC was very active in that field
    and we have managed with the support of our friends and also the Russian Federation
    to pass many resolutions against defamation of religions, not only Islam but all
    the religions. However, unfortunately the European countries and the US were against
    this at the beginning, saying that they do not agree with the notion of defamation
    of religions. it is not an unacceptable principle, we understand your worries
    on conscience but this is, legally speaking, not the proper way of doing things.
    Some of them and particularly the US were open and clear that they sympathized
    with us, but they had a problem because of the first amendment of their constitution
    on the notion of defamation. Without going into the details of that, we tried
    to find some new ways; and came with a proposal, consisting of eight points, which
    I presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in 2010; and the draft resolution
    was accepted by everybody. A similar resolution was also submitted to the UN General
    Assembly, and adopted subsequently in the past three years, and now we have five
    resolutions already. The Islamic world, as a whole, has at its goal the enshrinement
    of religion as beyond criticism and the criminalization of blasphemy and religious
    criticism, and has pushed for U.N. Resolutions to achieve that goal. '

    Muslims in Yugoslavia and Catholic-Buddhist warfare in Vietnam. All in the last
    50 years. The cultural argument seems dumb. People kill other people for all sorts
    of reasons and any old excuse will do. Europeans killed off several tens of millions
    of people during WWI because some guy got assasinated. Then the Europeans killed
    off several million more when Hitler got the support of Germans to make Germany
    great again. The Japanese did all sorts of unspeakably horrible things to the
    Chinese and Western POWs during that same war. The U.S. killed tens of thousands
    of people over the last century in order to prevent the spread of communism and
    to create free and democratic governments and helped to kill thousands more by
    supporting dictators that would keep communism out. The communists killed millions
    through cultural revolutions and fighting with the U.S. How are the Muslims in

    Targeted military/strategic strikes are a very different thing than specifically
    going after civilians and lobbing rockets into population centers just to scare
    people. I''m not going to try to defend what the Axis powers did, just point out
    that many of the people responsible for those decisions were prosecuted for war
    crimes/crimes against humanity. Stalin and Mao were just as bad as Hitler, they
    just did most of the damage inside their own countries. That''s not a good thing,
    but does change the urgency of response. The Iranians have public parades with
    mock beheadings of Sunni enemies and support terrorist actions around the globe..
    The Palestinians give pensions to the families of suicide bombers that take out
    cafes/buses full of people going to work. Honestly a lot of Wahhabi Saudis dance
    pretty close to the same lines. Just because others have done things as bad or
    possibly worse doesn''t mean people of conscience shouldn''t condemn or try to

    Muslims in Yugoslavia and Catholic-Buddhist warfare in Vietnam. All in the last
    50 years. The cultural argument seems dumb. People kill other people for all sorts
    of reasons and any old excuse will do. Europeans killed off several tens of millions
    of people during WWI because some guy got assasinated. Then the Europeans killed
    off several million more when Hitler got the support of Germans to make Germany
    great again. The Japanese did all sorts of unspeakably horrible things to the
    Chinese and Western POWs during that same war. The U.S. killed tens of thousands
    of people over the last century in order to prevent the spread of communism and
    to create free and democratic governments and helped to kill thousands more by
    supporting dictators that would keep communism out. The communists killed millions
    through cultural revolutions and fighting with the U.S. How are the Muslims in
    the Middle East the barbaric ones when they''ve probably killed the least number
    of people off compared to Europeans, the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Americans?
    When the Germans were killing people under Hitler we didn''t sit on our hands
    and pretend it wasn''t a problem because 100 years before that the French had
    done some conquering themselves. We''re facing a pretty serious culture war. The
    fastest growing ideology in the world is batshit insanity, and if you think it''s

    Sunni enemies and support terrorist actions around the globe.. The Palestinians
    give pensions to the families of suicide bombers that take out cafes/buses full

    Israelis? I agree that suicide bombings are horrible things, but if you are fighting
    an enemy that out guns you in every way possible it is probably your most effective
    option if you aren''t willing to surrender. You could fight your enemy face to
    face, but that''s just going to mean 400 of your soldiers dead for every one of

    bombings, every one of your dead soldiers takes several of the enemies people
    with them and if you kill enough perhaps the public in the enemy land will ask
    their leaders to negotiate and end the fighting. So from that perspective, I''m
    not sure that it is all that different for the Palestinians to give pensions to

    during WWII, the FARC in Columbia, the Mujaheddin in the Afghani war against Russia,
    or the militant wing of the African National Congress. among others. Whether they
    are terrorists or freedom fighters depends on what you think of the Israeli treatment
    of Palestinians. '

    Bosnian War, and the Bosnian genocide, the violence assumed a gender-targeted
    form through the use of rape. While men from all ethnic groups committed rape,
    the great majority of rapes were perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces of the Army
    of the Republika Srpska (VRS) and Serb paramilitary units, who used genocidal
    rape as an instrument of terror as part of their programme of ethnic cleansing.[1][2][3]
    Estimates of the total number of women raped during the war range from 12,000
    to 50,000.[4][5] The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
    (ICTY) declared that &quot;systematic rape&quot;, and &quot;sexual enslavement&quot;
    in time of war was a crime against humanity, second only to the war crime of genocide.
    Although the ICTY did not treat the mass rapes as genocide, many have concluded
    from the organized, and systematic nature of the mass rapes of the female Bosniak
    (Bosnian Muslim) population, that these rapes were a part of a larger campaign
    of genocide,[6][7][8] and that the VRS were carrying out a policy of genocidal
    rape against the Bosnian Muslim ethnic group.[9] The trial of VRS member Dragoljub
    Kunarac was the first time in any national or international jurisprudence that
    a person was convicted of using rape as a weapon of war. The widespread media
    coverage of the atrocities by Serbian paramilitary and military forces against
    Bosniak women and children, drew international condemnation of the Serbian forces.[10][11]
    Following the war, several award-winning documentaries and feature films were
    produced which cover the rapes and their aftermath. '

    this post. Don''t feel you need to respond to it. '

    President. People are still fighting to force Christian only prayers at schools
    and government meetings and the placement of the Ten Commandments in every classroom.

    killing of Martin Luther King, Jr., and I used this fact to illustrate that racism
    is a very serious problem in America and not just a tiny minority viewpoint, would
    you then chastise me for doing so and redirect the conversation to the number
    of people who die in traffic accidents or some other irrelevant nonsense? '

    is the same thing as when someone says &quot;But what about black-on-black crime!&quot;
